She's no pixy, but she's not huge either, and it was VERY tight on her, so I doubt a 6 year old can fit it comfortably.  The tutu fell apart after 12 hours -- the satin waistband detached from the tulle.  Unless twirling counts as rough wear, I'd say this was poorly constructed.  I sent two messages to Sydney So Sweet directly, trying to get a replacement or at least some kind of acknowledgement and NOTHING.  So ... crappy construction and crappy customer service.  I already don't like tutu/fairy/princess stuff, and this just furthers my opinion that companies like this are preying on daughters.  Boo!",

It is pretty long on her right now like a full length tutu but that makes it even prettier on her at this point.

While my little girl is a bit of a tomboy, as she is overshadowed by 5 older brothers, she does enjoy wearing this over her jeggings and running around and playing. Her playdates, two who are closer to 3, are madly in love with the tutus--it's a good thing we only have one of them at a time. I think that it would ideally fit a 3 or 4 year old without any stretch, but could fit kids possibly up to the age of twelve with the amount of stretch it has. The elastic has very nice give and the layers of tulle are very nicely proportioned and soft. After throwing it in the wash, the edges can curl a little with minimal fray--maybe I could have put it on a gentler cycle, but it looks pretty much lithe same. I really like the way the elastic is sewn in. The satin edge is part of the tulle fabric, not sewn on, and the elastic is enclosed between the layers of the satin edge, making it seem pretty secure. I have made my own tutus, but they never looked as nice or were so soft.",

I opened the package, which did come quickly in the mail, to find a skirt with a single layer of tool, folded in half and sewn together at the top. No other layers then that. There are some rose petals in the middle of the folded tool and a cheap looking rose glued to the front, with excess glue dripping on the petals. It also clearly says \" Made in China \" on the tag. It's such poor quality, I feel completely ripped off! If I saw this in a store I would NOT buy it, but if I had to, I wouldn't spend more then $3.00.",

All closed up, it's just as cute as can be. I'm very pleased with the overall looks of it. I've never had hanging storage for my necklaces before, and I do like this feature. The only fault I find is with the earring storage area that has plastic inserts. Nine holes per insert, which means I'd have to separate one pair. Having to attach the earrings through the holes is bothersome, too, and the plastic is just ugly. I'd much rather just have the little divided spaces to drop the earrings into.  I've removed the inserts (they just slide up and out) and am using the space for something else.I'm not sure how useful the little travel box will be, but it's cute, and it's kind of neat that it will fit right into the box or can be left out and that space used to store something else. I was a bit shocked when I started looking at jewelry storage prices, and I believe this item gives a lot of good storage for the money. And, (can I say it again?) it's just so darned cute - at least in pink!",

But if you have a lot of costume bling jewelry like me this isn't made to hold all of your jewelry. All of the jewelry I am taking with me on vacation fit but my necklaces and I had to do a few rearrangments with my bracelets. So now I have to come up with a different way to travel with my necklace collection. But over all this is a good product and the smell they speak of is just the new smell and my husband was surprised at all I could fit in but like I said I took the small travel case out and had to rearrange a lot of my bracelets and bling earrings. Good for traveling case and childrens jewelry case. This product is not for permanant home use for a complete collection of costume bling jewelry.

The mirror is great, the pale pink color is great and the flip open sides are great as well.  There is tons of storage so she can use it for years to come and even as a teenager without being embarrassed by cartoon artwork that she was into as a child (I almost got a Disney princess one, but thought better of it).  She could even use this as an adult and keep it for her daughter since its made of leather and is well constructed.  The little removable box is great for travel and she's already used it to come visit us for the Fourth of July!  The travel box has a place to slide a little plastic panel with holes in it for earrings!  I am very happy with this purchase and my bling loving, mature niece loves it too.

Most importantly, the two buttons holding the side pockets fell apart on first use, so now the sides flap around anytime the box is moved around.Would most certainly never buy this item again, because I did not expect such a poor quality from reading all previous reviews. My wife is happy though as it has plenty of space, but I feel like I wasted a lot of money and should have looked around (and maybe paid) more to get something that lasts a little longer than 10 minutes.",

My granddaughter likes the Shining Image Jewelry Box given to her for a birthday gift from Grandma.  I wish the drawers were deeper for holding her many necklaces.  Also, I wish the drawers had a stop, preventing the drawers from tipping contents entirely when trying to remove one piece of jewelry.  My granddaughter is only five years old, so having the background knowledge of knowing when to stop the action of pulling the drawer from the base requires practice.  I, on the other hand, have had lacks of years of practice with jewelry drawers, but also struggle with removing the drawer without spilling the contents.",

It is roomy and holds lots of pieces within a relatively compact case. It has lots of room for earrings. That is primarily what I own. I don't wear rings, and I only have a handful of necklaces and chains. It also has an absolutely adorable carrying case for travel. This jewelry box also has a mirror under the lid and the whole case folds up and locks securely! I love it!  Before I bought this, I had kept my jewelry in an assortment of little ceramic boxes that cluttered up my dresser.  Now, all is consolidated into a single, attractive case that fits nicely on my dresser. I am very satisfied with my choice.  I might add that I looked at almost every jewelry case that Amazon offered and I kept coming back to this one. The price was right and the product is wonderful.  Don't be misled by the color in the pictures.  The color I purchased (the pink) is even prettier than depicted.",

The box was lifted up by the handle, and the cheap lock did not engage so the box opened, all the drawers fell out and the pink thin leather tore away from the cardboard frame, leaving the top and back exposed to gray cardboard.  ugh!When I shipped it back for a replacement, thinking it was likely a once in a lifetime accident, they instead refunded my money... and did not email me a single note about anything! I had to find out by checking my bank account, and even then, they only refunded $10 of the return freight when it was nearly $30 to ship back!So, when I went back to REPLACE the case, as I originally requested, they said SURE!  BUT ...  it will cost you more!  In fact, between the cost of shipping it back (exactly $28.77) and the higher cost of new re-purchase (more than $20 more), the box would have ended up costing me a total of OVER $100 FOR THIS CASE!  A CASE THAT FELL APART WHEN LIFTED BY THE HANDLE!  Fooled me once ... never again.BAD PRODUCT QUALITY.  WORSE RETURN POLICY.  RUDE EMPLOYEES. I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from these people!

The button that opens the latch is the same color as the case, not the brass color in the image. Overall the case feels poorly made and it had been crushed a bit in shipping it seems since the latch takes a lot of force to properly close.Just as important as the looks, is the fact than the case is actually a bit smaller than described.I measure the exterior at 146mm X 54mm. More importantly (and I don't know why sellers don't ever provide these dimensions) the interior dimensions are even smaller, so my glasses don't fit. I measure the useable interior space at 130mm x 52mm x 27mm (at the widest point then tapers dramatically because of oval shape).",

It's lightweight, yet warm - great for clubbing or to wear to the mall shopping etc. Great for a ski or snowboarding trip to wear around the lodge or under your winter jacket for layering. The sleeve ends are matching elastic cloth as is the bottom of the jacket so it hugs your waist, has 2 pockets, durable zipper, the pom pom ties are ADORABLE!  Just like the ad says, the sizes do run more on the small side, but zip up hoodies are pretty universal sized for the average young adult or woman. Basically one size should fit most unless your really big or really tiny.  I've looked around for a long time trying to find one of these and they do seem to be hard to come buy.

Their white surface (the side you want to write on) is the perfect surface to write on with nearly any medium. I tried permanent marker, pencil, and several different paints. I bought this item to ask a girl to prom with P R O M ? (then my name) with a character on each puzzle. I thought that was pretty crafty, I used high-quality watercolors to paint the letters and the paint stuck surprisingly well. I'm very happy with this product and if I ever need to send creative and \"puzzling\" messages I'll be sure to buy again. Plus it's a great price! Oh and you're probably wondering, she said yes :D",

    "reviewText": "Okay, I do actually own this product, and I have also been a student of Arabic for some years now. I really would not recommend Rosetta Stone products for non-European languages for several reasons, but I focus on the Arabic here (and I assume the learner is a native English speaker):-The type of Arabic this teaches you is called Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or Fusha. This is the \"higher register\" of Arabic which is used in formal settings by the educated class: the news, academics, some clerics, most literature. Generally, Arabic speakers use a local dialect of Arabic, which is very, very different from this version of the language. For instance: imagine reading a work of Medieval \"Middle\" English. The language would be mostly quasi-familiar English words, but most of the usage, pronunciation, and grammar would seem tricky, overly complex, or old-fashioned. You would be able to understand some of it, but would miss a bit, too. \"The sky is blue\" would be like \"de heofon ist hewn bleu.\" MSA is like that to 90% of Arabic speakers: not totally gibberish, but not approachable either. Don't misunderstand me though, all Arabic learners should learn MSA, but know that you won't be speaking it much.-The reverse is also a problem. You can speak all the MSA you want (from Rosetta Stone or elsewhere) but almost no one will speak it back to you, and some people will literally laugh in your face for speaking that way. None of the living dialects of Arabic are that close to MSA, so even if you memorized every word of Rosetta Stone Arabic, you would not be able to understand almost anyone who didn't go to university.-To make matters even weirder, Rosetta Stone Arabic included the highly complicated case endings (called Iraab) on all the words. That is to say, there are certain changes to the last vowels of most words in the most formal of formal Arabic literature, like the Qur'an, the Bible, and poetry. These case endings mark what part of speech is being used, so for example \"kitaab\" is \"book,\" \"kitaabun\" is \"book\" if it is the subject of the sentence, \"kitaabi\" is \"book\" if it is direct object, \"kitaaba\" is \"book\" if it is in a prepositional phrase, etc. It is very complex and NO ONE EVER, EVER SPEAKS THAT WAY, even in MSA. Iraab use is technically correct, but even native speakers get confused by it (and rightly so). Not only does it not reflect any normal Arabic speech, because Rosetta Stone does not explain any grammar directly, I seriously doubt anyone would be able to sort out the meanings of the case endings just from context. This one was a major blunder that is mind-boggling for such an expensive product.-More on the grammar bit: it is great that Rosetta Stone wants to avoid speaking English, but Arabic grammar is not intuitive for English speakers. Therefore, unless you already have a fair bit of Arabic grammar, you will be completely confused. For example, in Arabic there is a system of root letters that make up most words. The pattern of these roots changes depending on meaning, so if a book is \"green\" it is \"akhdar,\" but if a car is \"green\" it is \"khadr'.\" Unless you already know that Arabic has a masculine/feminine gender system, and a root for greeness based on the letters kh-d-r, you would not be able to deduce what was happening (I really, really doubt it anyway.) Arabic has lots of grammar that throws English speakers for a loop and needs to be explained directly and in detail: there are tons of ways to pluralize, a \"dual\" case between singular and plural, a very different sentence structure, and on and on.-There is no cultural context provided, which is really strange. Why would I need to know the word for \"sandwich\" in the formal register of Arabic? Why does it teach how to say someone is \"Russian\" or \"Japanese\" and not how to say they are \"Jordanian,\" \"Saudi Arabian,\" or \"Moroccan\"?I could only imagine two reasons someone would find Rosetta Stone Arabic useful:1. If they already spoke some Arabic and wanted a refresher course in the more formal parts of the language, which I guess could happen.2. They wanted to focus specifically on Arabic literature of some sort and already had some familiarity with Arabic grammar and syntax.Do not buy this product if:1. You want to learn Arabic from scratch on your own. You will learn nothing at all, I swear.2. You are traveling to the Arab world and want some basic speaking skills.3. You want to learn about Arab culture or the language's use and history.I didn't intend to rant but this is a very expensive product and it really is not worth the cd its copied on. If you want to learn MSA or one of the many dialects (or better yet, both), get a dictionary, a class, and a plane ticket.",

    "reviewText": "So much has been said and advertised about this product that giving it less than 5 stars might raise a few eyebrows. I'll preface this by saying that I was a public school teacher for many years, grew up with languages and spend every day, now, working with Iraqi refugees.  This might sound like the perfect situation to purchase Arabic by Rosetta Stone? Not so.  First of all, the headset/microphone was of poor quality and only picks up my words now and then. It's difficult to score well when the program thinks you are not speaking. Secondly, one should understand that there is not one word of English with this product nor did I receive any instructions on how to use it. It became trial and error. Thirdly, I was unaware that the dialects in Arabic are so numerous that Rosetta stone was not terribly useful when speaking with Iraqis.  This is, by no means, the fault of Rosetta Stone but I wish I knew this before my purchase. Lastly, so many of the lessons used phrases that were of no use to me in the real world in which I work. Again, Rosetta Stone would not have any idea which phrases to teach and which phrases to use but I have, yet, no need to be able to talk about a group of men who might be running or a woman eating an apple. Yes, I am being facetious but not terribly so.Bottom line: do a bit of homework before making this, somewhat, costly investment. It is not instant access to a foreign language as the ads would have you believe.",

I feel like I've been cheated.  I paid almost $200 for a virtually worthless program.  If you cannot read the Arabic alphabet you are pretty much screwed.  Lesson one starts with an Arabic phrase popping up on the screen, which you repeat.  Regardless of how you pronounce it it gives you the green light then continues.  It repeats a phrase, then you select one of the four pictures below.  You figure it out after failing for a while that they are saying boy, girl, man, woman, etc...  Bash your head against the keyboard for a bit longer, then you go on to another lesson.  You are given no grammar, no explanation of what you are saying or doing.  It's immersion alright, but with no practical application.  Did I mention it's MSA(Modern Standard Arabic)?  If you do figure out what you are supposed to be learning, try whipping out some awesome MSA to a native speaker of Arabic and watch them try to smile and find a polite way to let you know you sound like an idiot.  I will never buy Rosetta Stone products ever again.",

    "reviewText": "Many people complain about no English translations on the screen when you hear new words and phrases.It's important to realize that when using Rosetta Stone, you are not supposed to completely understand the words/phrases when you hear them the first time, or even the second or third.  You're not supposed to know the answers before the software asks you to interact.  Rosetta Stone forces your mind to grasp at possible meanings until you puzzle it out, and when you do finally puzzle it out, a light bulb flashes on and true comprehension takes place.Rosetta Stone integrates failure and 'learning by trial and error' directly into the program which, for me, makes the vocabulary and usage far more concrete in my head than being told what something means then picking it out of a list.  What good does that do?If you pay attention to the pictures and the context in which they are displayed, you really can intuit the meanings of the words and phrases.  After you fail to choose the correct answers then finally get it right, this stuff will be burned into your memory because you've been actively engaged in the 'discovery of the language.  Exactly like a kid does.  Exactly what Rosetta Stone claims.To summarize: you can't sit there and passively learn the language.  Rosetta Stone won't download it into your brain.  You have to actively interpret what you're seeing with what's being said in the new language.  It's amazing how much language and nuance can be assimilated in this way.",

The one time I was in a position to try the \"de-activate\" feature it did not return the license.After you run out of your two installs you then have to call their technical support for each and every install after.  If you are a tech type who upgrades systems and OSes frequently this literally results in HOURS of extra overhead spent on the line with indian tech support to get your licenses reinstated.

Day after day I sat down with this product, and went through the level one modules.  The problem with learning language becomes immediately apparent when you realize you can say things like \"these are two boys\" or \"the table has five plates\" but cannot say tho most basic survival phrases such as \"Hello my name is_______\".  Also I encountered a phenomenon where I could remember the words when using Rosetta stone, but not in real life on the streets and in the classroom.  I thought I was a terrible language learner.Language acquisition research has shown motivation to be one of the highest factors of success in learning a language.  Rosetta stone is extremely demotivating.  It does not teach practical language.  If they included basic survival conversations from the very beginning, this would be a much better product, however the developers have chosen instead to recreate an experience of using an extremely large and onerous set of flashcards.I had used Rosetta stone for four months.  I saw very little progress in my ability to actually use the language.  Then in Shanghai I bought a simple textbook for about $5 that used dialogues with an audio CD included.  I studied this for a week and my Chinese ability skyrocketed.  This was because I was learning the simple survival language that humans use everyday and I desperately needed.Don't believe the marketing hype.  A child learns their first language over a period of about 7 years.  A baby can learn a bunch of random vocabulary words and simple grammatical structures without needing to say things like where is the bathroom?  The child just has to cry and someone figures out what is wrong.  Most adults would like to avoid sitting in a restaurant and crying until someone figures out they need to use the bathroom.  It is extremely demotivating to know how to say \"He takes the red flowers\" but not be able to say \"I want a glass of water please\".  Buy a $20 textbook with an audio CD.  Go through the lessons and listen to the conversations on the audio CD.  Use the rest of your money to pay a tutor to speak chinese with you.  You will learn Chinese and any other language much faster this way.",

    "reviewText": "There are many different ideas on the best way for adults to learn a foreign language. Much depends on the student, their goals, and their self-discipline. Dealing with a tonal language or a language with a different script, the student need make some big decisions about how they want to learn, and how much. Relatively speaking, Filipino/Pilipino/Tagalog is easy.I learned Spanish as an adult. I am now fluent at a professional/business level. About 10-15% of Tagalog is Spanish, and the spelling of Tagalog words are all based on Spanish sounds.I learned to read Thai. I can write some, but my vocabulary is very small. 90% of my Thai came from taking private one-on-one classes while living in Thailand for 6 months.I studied some Tagalog, some Korean, and some Thai using Rosetta Stone.If you just want to learn some Tagalog to get around as a tourist, enough people speak excellent English in the Philippines you will probably never be able to use it. The Filipinos who don't speak English will typically avoid speaking to you, even when you try to speak Tagalog. Regardless, an immersion product, like Rosetta Stone, is probably not as useful because much of the vocabulary and context is not related to what you will want to know (do you really need to say the boy is under the soccer ball?).If you want to seriously learn the language to be able to carry on casual or business conversations, commit early and realize there is far more work involved. To really practice Tagalog, you will need to go to less savory parts of Manila, or plan on getting outside of Manila, Cebu, away from the red light districts in Olongapo and Angeles, and avoid the resort areas like Puerta Galera and Boracay. To really use Tagalog, you need to go to areas where those who don't speak English are willing to make an effort to understand you.For me, I first needed to learn the alphabet. Since spelling is based on Spanish phonetics and the Roman alphabet, this was easy for me with Tagalog. For other languages, like Thai, you CANNOT consistently pronounce Thai correctly using Romanized phonetics. T one rules are only consistent in Thai script.  Among other challenges, the Romanization is wildly inconsistent. You learn it one way, and then another source using different phonetics mires you in confusion. The same is probably also true of Korean, as it is also a phonetic language. Learning Chinese will likely be different. This part of Tagalog is easy though.Second, I realized for me, I need to take notes. As adults we want to take notes to help remember key points. If you take the notes in English, you are handicapping yourself. This is more difficult, and far more important, in languages with their own script.Third, again for me, I knew learning translation would create a permanent handicap. Early on, translation is easier, later on translation must be unlearned as it stilts actual conversation and thinking. You just can't translate fast enough. Even now, being fluent in Spanish, translating gives me a headache and frustrates me. I either have a conversation in Spanish, thinking in Spanish, or I have a conversation in English thinking in English. If I know a word in one language and not the other, my whole train of thought is derailed. Avoiding learning translation is where Rosetta Stone shines.I like the idea of Rosetta Stone. If you are disciplined and do the lessons, you will expand your spoken vocabulary rapidly. You will remember what you learn. For reading and writing, Rosetta Stone is limited. I doubt it will do much for reading and writing with non-Roman scripts. Like any learning tool, disciplined study will yield results.Rosetta Stone is very expensive. Competing products like L-Lingo or products using different methods like Pimsleur, TellMeMore.com, Assimil, or Fluenz (supposedly the best, but only in a few languages) are a fraction of the cost of Rosetta Stone. Many of the different methods will work better for some people than others. Assimil is translation based. Pimsleur is hard to describe, but has a very good fluency success rate (supposedly). Look up Fluenz also, as the method and reviews suggest it is very effective in the few languages they offer.Besides cost, what is the other drawback to Rosetta Stone?The drawbacks are legion.Version 2 is good. Version 2 is how Rosetta Stone grew into a powerhouse. The voice recognition is very primitive. Version 3 is a refinement of version 2 with improved continuity, a smoother interface, better quizzes, and the ability to get rid of the stupid \"must have CD with you at all times\" limitation. You can also advance or return to the exact spot where you left off earlier.Unfortunately, Rosetta Stone dropped support for Version 2. Even though they were selling version 2 from their own website in 2012, they dropped support. Mac users are especially impacted as Mac OSX Lion will no longer run PPC apps, and Rosetta Stone never ported Version 2 to Intel. So, if you bought Version 2 in 2012 to use on a Mac, you were ripped off by Rosetta Stone. Join the crowd.Windows users should not be too smug about the situation, as the end of Version 2 support means your product will have all sorts of issues too, unless you downgrade to WinXP.Version 3 does run on current platforms, and is at least somewhat supported (to the extent Rosetta Stone supports any product). Version 3 is easily the pinnacle of Rosetta Stone software. Given so many users prefer version 3 to version 4 though, don't be surprised if they pull a Microsoft and force you to their new product nobody wants.Total 4e, is a retrograde of Rosetta Stone. To be fair, if you are always connected -- literally 100% of the time, never a lost packet -- and live your life via social media, Total 4e might be effective. Don't expect to use the highly touted iOS apps on your iPhone or iPad though unless you are connected 100% of the time with those devices also. The whole idea of quickly practicing while in line or waiting in an office...yeah, that doesn't conform to the Rosetta Stone licensing model.Speaking of which, Rosetta Stone now has two components and two licensing models. There is the software application and the online social media part. The application can be run as long as they support it on current platforms. The online social media component is now on a subscription basis. You pay for every month in which you want to participate. You can still use the app on your computer, but you just paid a premium for online access you aren't using unless you continue to pay the subscription.Given there are many free or lower cost websites where learners can interact and practice language skills, why pay Rosetta Stone a monthly premium for less content? Therein lies the reason so many people look at Total 4e and then try to find version 3 before supplies run out.How about another suggestion?Try L-Lingo. L-Lingo uses a very similar learning model to Rosetta Stone. The interface actually has more features than Rosetta Stone and you can customize the interface to use Roman phonetics or native script. They have iPad and iPhone/IPod Touch iOS apps which you can use on a plane, or anywhere else, with or without Internet access. Best of all, all of their programs together (Win or Mac desktop, iPad, iPhone/iPod Touch) are less than half the cost of Rosetta Stone Level I.L-Lingo specializes in Asian languages. They are probably a superior option to Rosetta Stone Total 4e for most users. L-Lingo offers a free trial for their desktop application, and also for their iOS applicastions for some languages.There are other good options listed above, particularly Fluenz and Pimsleur which use different methods. Be sure to check them out before buying anything published by Rosetta Stone.",

With only limited time to practice in the evenings I'm learning fast and can now say several words and simple sentences.  I'm nowhere near fluent, but it's a start and if I keep making progress at this speed, I may be fluent in no time!PROS: Easy to use, has short lessons (from 5 min to 30 min) if you're pressed for time and you can work at your own pace, love the voice recognition software so I know I'm saying things right, fun games and stories to increase vocabulary and reinforce what you've learned.  Has many different sections for different areas of language study - vocabulary, reading and writing, listening and speaking, pronunciation and grammar.  You can go back and repeat lessons or even just certain sections of the lessons if you didn't get a high score the first time. Also once you finish the final review or a lesson, it sets a date for you to go back and do the review again to reinforce everything so you don't lose those basics.CONS: You can only activate it on ONE computer (no putting it on your home computer and laptop - for your smart phone, however, there's an app for that!), nothing is explained or translated (not really a problem with vocabulary, but it would be nice to have the option of explaining the grammar a bit more - still pretty easy to pick up). The advertised chats with native speakers are only available during certain times (for instance for me it's 4pm-8pm PST) and you have to schedule a session.Granted I've not been using it long, but I'm already looking forward to buying phase 2 and 3 to complete my Tagalog learning. ^.^",

    "reviewText": "Since learning a language from software is not exactly the same as learning a language from going to live in the country itself, I suggest picking up the Rosetta Stone software 1 level at a time, like this French level 1. That way you know if you are able to learn from the software, before investing even more money into it. Since total immersion into another country to learn is not always an option, Rosetta Stone it the next best thing. While a class environment might work better for some, there's not always time for that either. Sometimes there's just enough time on the weekends, or in the evenings after work to get a few hours of studying in. Or maybe you just don't want to sit in a school like classroom, trying to learn from an instructor. That's where Rosetta Stone comes in.Rosetta Stone tries to be more than just a computer program. Instead it's interactive, and is a cross between software and an at-home classroom Spanish lesson. The software comes with a headset and microphone so that while you are learning, you also speak into the headset and respond to questions. The software helps one learn how to pronounce the words and practice what you've learned to help retain it. Unlike a classroom environment, you can work at this at your own pace, which I appreciate. When I took a Spanish class, some of the students flew ahead of me, while the rest of us were just trying to keep up. Rosetta Stone lets a person learn at the pace they learn at (fast or slow) so they don't end up missing anything along the way. I'm more comfortable learning from the program as well, than in front of a group of strangers .While going to France and living there for a while is probably the easiest and fastest way to learn French, Rosetta Stone is the next best thing, and a more realistic option for most people.",

I was hoping this product would be able to overcome my genetic inability to speak anything other than English. After installing the product, I started down the path to learn French. I figured maybe I needed to try a different language, which is why I selected the French version. The software itself was easy to install and offers a free 3 month online version for my smartphone. I tried multiple times, I really tried but my genetics overcame my willpower to speak a different language.For those that haven't seen the software in use, you are presented with pictures of men, women, children, etc performing different activities. You learn how to say women vs woman, men vs man, etc. The software builds on what you have learned, adding another level of complexity, which I am sure works for a lot of people, but not for me. My expectations were high and I didn't have any issues with the software, my brain on the other hand just refused to adapt. I honestly couldn't blame Rosetta stone for my lack of retention or ability to make my words sound like their words.That being said, I think full immersion in the culture along with this course would be optimal way to use this software.Even after my failure, I would still recommend this program to another person.",

LOL.So I got this and installed it and tried it out. One key thing that you need to remember is that unless you actually sit there and speak the words then it's not going to do you nearly as much good as it could. Participate in it fully and you'll get much farther than you think you would.Now there are a lot of different language learning softwares on the market but rosetta stone seems to be a very well respected one and from what I've experienced they kind of deserve the respect. Would I like it somethings were different...? Of course, I would like the world to bend to my will... LOL. But none the less it's a great bit of software, well more like a lot of software.Some Pros:Unlike a lot of generic software RS makes it a point to associate words with concepts and ideas while other programs just give you a translation, this helps with the learning process greatly.Vocabulary, without a big vocabulary it's going to be hard to understand what's being said and how to respond. RS teaches you a large variety or words to help with understanding.Cons:I really disliked the lack of language structure given in terms of grammatical uses of the words for spoken language, as in how to speak properly. In this beginners level it seems to concentrate mainly on just teaching you the words instead of giving you a combination of words and how to implement them properly. Granted this is Level 1 but it would have been much nicer if there was a lot more sentence structure given versus just the vocabulary and small hints at structure.All in all it's helpful as I can now make out what my relatives are now saying when I speak to them on skype or other means, which is great but I still have a lot to learn to really speak the language.My other issue with the software is the price.... I find it pretty over priced for what you get in just one level of the software. I haven't tried a whole lot of the other systems out there but I do know a few who have and those who have have all commented that this software is overpriced for what you get compared to other systems out there. Overall, I don't know that I would spend the asking price on this software for what you get with it...Good luck to those that are trying to expand their horizons and learn more languages, I wish you all success.",

Is it the boy? The Table? The grass? Something about the Boy? His hair? Something about his hair? You have no idea what the audio is talking about. You eventually figure out which picture is meant, but you have no idea why in most cases.From there, the difficulty and length of sentences increases exponentially till you are listening to paragraphs about your choices. Epic Fail as they say. Let us also keep in mind that it takes a child nearly two years to begin to speak....like a two year old.

I really do like the learning process, it feels intuitive.  The problem is, sitting at my desktop computer is inconvenient and I do not have a laptop.  So when I learned that there is an \"App for that\", I was thrilled.  I own both an iPhone and an iPad so with the Rosetta Stone apps that link directly to my account I could learn and practice wherever I needed to.  For three months I made great progress whether at home, in the backyard or at work on my lunch hour.  On day 91 I suddenly could not connect, my apps kept saying \"no course found for this account\".  The product still works on my desktop but it turns out the apps portion of the product was just a free trial.  If I want to continue learning this way I need to purchase a very expensive subscription.  No where on this product page does it say that the companion apps are a trial version.  I am very disappointed with Rosetta Stone and Amazon.  I did call Amazon but the rep I spoke to did not know whether the product info was written by Rosetta Stone or Amazon, I am sure it was the former.  Amazon did try to assist me by offering a partial refund but that was not really what I wanted.  I want to continue to learn on my iPad!  My disappointed with Amazon is because that call I made to them took place about two months ago and I see the product info page has not changed, I do not see anything about the iPhone apps being a 90 day trial.UPDATE: AUGUST 23, 2013I see that Amazon has updated the description slightly with this sentence, \"Enhance your learning on-the-go with Rosetta Stone mobile apps for the Kindle Fire HD, iPad and iPhone.

    "reviewText": "The first question was which computers to install this program - Rosetta Stone has a two seat minimum. I ended up putting the 2nd installation on a laptop, expecting to use the program in other locations.  However, Rosetta Stone's immersion method feels too intensive to me for use in most places away from home.  Installation was easy enough even though the program got stuck a couple of times along the way. The gear, headset with microphone, is sufficient.Pros:* For total immersion-type instruction without the benefit of communicating with other people, this seemed very good.* The voice recognition software is impressive. I was able to immediately begin speaking and progressed to the second level of difficulty fairly quickly. There are plenty of exercises and repetition, and this will surely help in many ways including pronunciation.* There are learning sessions in this software to allow speaking with native French speakers.*For me as an individual, this is a better way to learn than a formal classroom.Cons:* The limitation in the number of seats (2). This wasn't a problem for me yet it's something to know about.* Lack of matching supplemental physical material such as index cards with conjugations and grammatical rules. I feel the need for this and can source it out separately, but again I prefer to learn outside a formal classroom.* Lack of simple visuals to help with identifying grammatical patterns.",

    "reviewText": "I thought I'd give this a try during the summer before I started my university French class. I've taken Spanish before, but that was almost 10 years ago, and the only other language (besides English) I became proficient at was Hmong, which I learned through a religious text in Hmong and in English, some flash cards and a dictionary that was Hmong to English, in addition to spending time around native speakers daily.I don't believe there is a perfect way to learn a language, and our minds are far different than they were when we were children. Rosetta Stone does seem to be effective, though. I remember almost everything I've learned, and the grammar starts to identify itself as you work through it. I wouldn't go in with the mindset that everything is exactly as it seems; French, like Spanish, has verb tenses, and they all sound similar (moreso than Spanish), but if you watch for them, they become clear. Rosetta Stone makes you work a bit harder for the grammar, but the vocabulary comes pretty easily. I don't believe language learning is easy; it's hard to learn how to say the words, how to use them, and for me, hard to hear them coming from the mouths of natives. Rosetta Stone does a good job because it uses native speakers of both genders to say the words. I think it has its flaws, like how finicky the audio recognition can be, and I find the lessons can get boring because they get a bit repetitive, but I think that is a personal thing.Also, I think it's a great tool for people trying to learn a language who don't have much educational background. Sometimes I would work with old Hmong women, and while they struggled with using the English Rosetta Stone, they would have struggled far more sitting in a class with me trying to teach them through translation, since most of them couldn't read Hmong anyway.I see it as a useful tool, and a unique one amongst the more normal solutions. I still recommend some reading and writing and grammar study, but a lot of that manifests itself in Rosetta Stone if you aren't too lazy about it. Good product. I like it.",

The learning system is very immersive and might seem daunting at first, but they do such a great job of breaking into down into very simple pieces that if you just \"go with it\" you'll find it really works.  My kids are picking up far faster than I am, but that's to be expected.  They're young, they hear several languages a day at school, and it's much more natural for them.  That said I'm picking up a little French and I'm just trying to have fun with it.  One of my kids is far more focused on it and he's picking up a lot more than I am.I think as long as you are willing to put in the time this really works.  A casual user like me isn't going to get more than a few phrases, but a serious person can and will learn.

    "reviewText": "After using this application for a while now, I've come to realize two major things about it, and things it has helped (and not helped.)First, it helps recognize what words (or \"root words\") mean.  The picture-based learning approach seems awkward at first, but once you become acclimated to what it's attempting to do, you start using it almost like a super-easy memory game.  And that's where things work extraordinarily well.  A super-easy memory game...to learn a new language?  Rosetta Stone proves that it can be done.  Learning foreign plural forms, nouns, and verbs has never been quite so easy...except...The voice recognition works well, but at the same time, it's quite weird to see a word with 7 characters but you only actually make sounds for the first half of the word; granted, it can be like that because of the language...but after using Rosetta Stone, I feel like this bit of awkwardness is actually needed for any serious language learning software.  It *should* be weird at first.The biggest issues I have with the software was:1.  When you first start it up, you're kind of left thinking \"Huh?  Where are the instructions in English?  How am I supposed to match the words (text and vocal) to a picture if I obviously have no idea what they're saying.\"  A short paragraph saying \"here's what you're going to do now\" would eliminate the feeling of \"did I just skip something on accident?\"2.  I'm not very far through it, so it may end up fixing the grammar and syntax later, but some of the words I still don't know what they actually are.  I can get the gist of them, but the matching isn't giving me a definite answer to the words I feel I'm somewhat learning.  (ie, Are the verbs all in the infinitive?)Overall, this is the best language software (and includes audio CD for on-the-go) that I've used, but at the same time, you're really not going to buy software, use it for a couple weeks, and then know everything.  The person wanting to learn (ahem, that's you) really needs to devote themselves and their time into doing it.  From what I've done thus far (not very devoted), I feel like I could understand a book written in French that was written for a 5-6 year old.  (While that may sound like an insult, coming in knowing no French whatsoever and using this software on-and-off for a while, it's actually a big heap of praise.)Would recommend as far as what the product does.  But if you're looking for the best value (perhaps if they'd stop advertising so much, they could lower the price), this is still a great product, but after buying a few Levels, you'd likely be better off taking a class instead.  (And have the motivation because you're \"expected\" to be there and you're trying to \"earn a grade.\")Overall...good software, and if you devote yourself to it, you'll likely be quite successful.",

Rather than learning the language through its building blocks you learn it through more practical and real world scenarios.  This helps tremendously if you want to use this set as a prep for travel (which I think this is very well suited for).The Rosetta Stone app has voice recognition so you can practice with the app itself. I found it to be pretty good although sometimes I had to repeat myself several times to get it right. Although the upside of this is that it made me speak more clearly which ultimately is a good thing.I really liked the Totale aspect of this edition. The Totale part is an online companion with games to play that I enjoyed.  Not all of them are blockbusters but there are enough to chose from that I found it to be worthwhile.  My favorite part of Totale was being able to chat with people who actually speak French natively. It's one thing to practice a language and quite another to ACTUALLY try to speak it with someone. I found the people to be very patient and the experience very positive.I'd definitely consider using Rosetta Stone in other languages to prep for trips abroad.

I didn't feel rushed through the lessons at all and the whole process played to my strenghts and weaknesses in the second language much like a glove would fit on one's hand.

    "reviewText": "I got this as a gift, and I knew it would not work for me, which is why I didn't buy it for myself. I like to understand the fundamentals of the way a language works before I just start memorizing words by looking at pictures, and Rosetta Stone doesn't teach you anything about that. You just have to figure it out. I understand the whole concept of immersion, but you need some kind of background on grammar. Five minutes about grammar at the beginning of every new chapter would solve that problem. There are rules that are very basic, like if something ends in A, in Spanish, it's probably feminine. If it ends in O, it's usually, but not always masculine. Regular verbs are conjugated the same way. I love, you love, we love. He is, she is, they are, we are, etc. But Rosetta Stone doesn't teach you anything about the language. They just keep showing you pictures of people doing stuff or eating stuff, and hope that you catch on. I took 4 years of Spanish, and have become more fluent by speaking it. But i also know the rules of the language, so I can read things I haven't seen before. I practiced French and German from cd's  and from books. I learned more from listening to cd's in my car than than Rosetta Stone. There is something to be said for teaching someone how to at least conjugate basic verbs, or explain the differences in gender in nouns. Rosetta Stone is like a video game where you just click on answers, but they don't explain why the answers are wrong or right. You can use common sense to get through the levels without learning much about the language. Then, they give you spelling tests without explaining the special characters. I can't just memorize accent marks because they popped up on the screen. Tell me when accent marks are used in general, so that I can understand when to use them. I don't know how you would ever learn to write in French, because they don't teach you how. They don't explain how to pronounce things, and French has a lot of extra syllables that are silent. They need to explain when, and why, they are silent. They expect you to copy what the people on the recording do. But, copying isn't learning a language. I already had a background in French before i got this, and I was still confused.",

This was my first experience with Rosetta Stone software and I like it. They really did one heck of a job making learning fun and easy. I highly recommend the software if you want to learn a second language, it looks like it is a good product. I would definitely try other languages after seeing just how easy it is to use this stuff.What didn't I like?For starters the headphones and microphone that came with it are NOT quality, they are not comfortable and my ears got really hot. It was like wearing styrofoam balls over my ear[...]. Sure wish they headphones were at least padded better. The microphone seemed to work well, my only gripe here is the comfort of wearing it. And if you follow this program you will wear it a lot!Second, it took nearly 30 minutes for me to install the software. I understand software piracy but between the lengthy install process, having to scratch off a 28 digit code from a little plastic card and manually enter that and the several updates I had to download it was a bit dull. I sure would have like a faster, easier program to install. So don't think you can just pop this in and you are good to go, you need to first install the application, then install the language pack, then update it (if updates are available) then you need to scratch off the secret code and activate the product, then you have to setup your user profile and THEN you can finally get started.Overall the product is good, I give it 4 stars out of 5 because the software is really the key here. The headset is low quality and that takes away from the experience. I would almost they NOT provide a headset then provide the one they did. And second the install was lengthy. I got the french lesson, I don't want to have to install the application and then a language pack. The software should be smart enough to install both the app and language pack together to make the process even easier.And yes, I am a software developer so when I review software I look at it from a complete implementation standpoint. Software is only as good as the installer.",

    "reviewText": "I have heard many great things about Rosetta Stone, but always from the perspective of a TV ad with the usual, glowing testimonials of 30 and 40-somethings who just rave about the product.Naturally, I've always been curious, but have usually been put off by the near $200 price-tag that usually accompanies it.  So, when Amazon Vine had it on offer, I decided to give it a try.Here's what I have to say about it after a week's exposure to my wife (aged 40+) and my daughter (age 7).Generally speaking, Rosetta Stone does a great job in exposing kids to vocabulary.  Nouns are attributed to actual pictorial representations instead of the \"x = y\" approach.  This generally works well, as we do a better job with image recognition than we do with word matching.However, that being said, this kind of representation works well when you're in the early years of school where such learning applies.  As adults, however, we have already a well-established mind set where learning doesn't equate well to a kindergarten-level.  That's typically why we, as adults, sometimes have a hard time relating simple concepts to younger children simply because we tend to use constructs that are far more complex.In other words, while pictorial representations (i.e. \"immersion\") works well to introduce new and unfamiliar words to kids, this doesn't work well when it comes to grammar.  Sentence construction is best introduced in the traditional way of learning how to conjugate \"-er\" verbs in French by establishing simple rules (which account for 65% of the verbs in the French language).  Once those rules are learned, then it's quite easy to follow.Rosetta doesn't take this approach, which is why it hurts both kids and adults for altogether different reasons.  For kids, the immersion approach doesn't work simply because the rules need to be learned by memorization which is an adult concept.  Why do kids say things like, \"I fell down and it hurtED\"...?  Because they take a simple rule, apply it, and they don't realize why it doesn't work; i.e., the \"immersion\" aspect doesn't prepare them for exceptions to rules, rather than the rules themselves.  For the same reason, adults learn better from learning verb conjugation through rules, not immersion; immersion doesn't cover how to conjugate verbs through conditional tense, past imperfect, etc. and French actually has a number of rules that are easier to follow through rote memorization instead of \"here you go...now speak!\"That said, this is only Level 1.  However, I would say that it's a great vocabulary primer...I just wouldn't use it to teach grammar.Maybe it works well for others, which is why I give it the benefit of 3 stars.  Children may benefit from it more because of the general learning construct, but I would have to say that it fails to convey grammar effectively.  The company has been around for awhile.  But from someone who speaks both French and English and has actually seen the difference in learning between various ages, I am somewhat dubious about their claims.  Buyers should exercise caution.",

The software grades the user's performance and will work on problem areas. It is dynamic immersion - there is no english anywhere once the lessons begin.Two minor drawbacks (one style and one substance) hinder Rosetta Stone. The style issue involves the use of pictures. Rather than exclusively use cultural situations and settings, the pictures depict a myriad of cultural situations and settings. I suppose it is both cheaper and easier to do this when Rosetta Stone offers programs in 31 languages. The second issue involves the microphone and voice recognition software. Basically, it doesn't work. You can say almost anything and the program will grant you a passing score.",

I've never taken any French classes before and wanted to try Rosetta Stone in hopes of attaining some basic language skills before an upcoming trip to Paris. At this point, I've been practicing for 45 minutes to an hour each day and am almost finished with the first unit (I think there are four or five units total in Level 1). I haven not attempted the games or live online tutoring yet, as I want to wait until I have a bit more practice under my belt.So far, I am pretty impressed with the software in general. As other reviewers have said, the style of learning is mainly picture-based, which seems to be working for me and would probably work for child learners as well. I've already learned a bunch of words and am speaking in basic sentences. For purposes of surviving a vacation to France, I think Rosetta Stone is the way to go. If I keep at this, I think I'll do pretty well asking for directions, ordering food in restaurants, and conversing with shopkeepers (there's an entire unit devoted to shopping which I haven't gotten to yet). However, people who are serious about learning the language from the ground up may be better off enrolling in an actual French language course with a real live instructor. While Rosetta Stone is teaching me basic vocabulary and sentences quickly, it doesn't explain grammar rules at all. The most confusing part for me so far is learning when to say things like \"le\" instead of \"la\" because Rosetta Stone just shows you what to use with certain words...it doesn't explain WHY. That has been frustrating for me and is making things more challenging as I progress through the lessons.Still, for my purposes, Rosetta Stone suits me just fine. More devoted scholars may want to look elsewhere, though.",

This system has given me a new appreciation for the language I was once scared of.The Rosetta Stone TOTALe packaging seemed big, until I opened it up and saw how much was crammed into the box:A nice USB headphone set, with built in microphone and padded ear cups.The actual Rosetta Stone software, for both Mac and PC, and the language specific lessons.Clear stick on labels for your keyboard (to help with the writing portion of the lessons).A CD/mp3 audio companion disc for practicing on the go or in your leisure time.A quick start guide.Authorization card to successfully install and use the software.Warranty information.The initial software install seemed to take a little bit of time, not more than 5 minutes though, but once it was finished the program started right up. The program automatically checked for software updates and gave me the option to download or continue with set up. I decided to download the update and I had to go through an installation for the update, but it went much more quickly than the first. Finally, after the program restarted and I selected the included microphone headset, I was asked to install the language I was working on.After placing the French I disc in and selecting the course, the program prompted that my drive only had space for 3 total courses (French I, II, and III), each at about 600mb. Hard drives are getting cheaper, but I thought it was worth noting that the entire French I course (this set you're looking at) is going to take about 600mb of space; I know that hard drive space can be an issue for some people.I was asked to input the activation code found on a card inside the package. I put the code in and the program connected online to verify it was legitimate.  When the authorization was complete, I was asked to fill out a profile, with my name and date of birth. I was given the option to also take part in the online sessions, which would allow me to practice my new skills with people proficient in the language. I noticed that I was offered a free 3 month trial period. I opted not to sign up for that feature, so I can't comment on its performance. Finally, there was a short introductory video (which I skipped since I'd already watched it online), at that point I was free to start my lessons.I picked the extended reading, writing, and speaking lessons, but there were options for reading and speaking only or reading and writing only, and so on. The core lesson takes you through the basics of the language, doing so only in French. It's full immersion and I was awestruck at how quickly I was picking things up, especially having never studied French. The use of descriptive images and repetitive audio cues, had me speaking a language and knowing what I was saying in matter of minutes. In less than ten minutes I knew several nouns and 3rd person pronouns, both male and female, and their spelling and I had gained the ability to spell and pronounce a number of activities (reading, drinking, eating, running, etc.). It was inspiring to feel successful, especially when half way through the lesson the words disappeared from the screen and I had make the right connections using what I had just learned.When all is said and done, I know I'm not going to be able to move to France and be mistaken as a native because of my excellent pronunciation and conversational skills learned from this program, but as a foundation for further learning and studying, it would be hard to beat this system. I would recommend it for all learners, young and old. I'm excited to learn more French!",

    "reviewText": "I completely agree with another review that \"children learn this way, not adults.\" It's true.While doing level 1, after each lesson I was wondering when I was going to learn the basics of French, like say, how to say what your name is or ask how someone is... a va? None of that is covered in level 1. (And so far not in level 2 either...) It's just a bunch of nouns overall. It teaches items and things VERY well, but not how to speak or understand French, which is what I thought was going to happen. The images are super helpful with stuff like that. Picture of a fish >> poisson! Great. But they then throw a bunch of weird grammar at you and you're supposed to know what the difference is between nous and vous by the end, but that didn't happen. It is quite confusing. I found myself keeping Google Translate open so I could understand what exactly the word was that I was being taught.A really, really great thing about Rosetta though is the audio/speaking part. You don't get that with a book. It is a huge plus, but not enough.Instead I have been using textbooks and activity books, and in a few hours have learned more about the basics of French than Rosetta's French Level 1 taught me. I did get some good rrrrrrrrrrrrr practice out of Rosetta though.There is no way you can learn a language through this \"immersion\" crap. I honestly could not even say hello, how are you, and goodbye after Level 1. The price is also completely ridiculous for how primitive it is.Using this ALONG with some books is great (just for pronunciation really), but alone is not worth that hefty price tag.Bonne chance.",

    "reviewText": "First off, let me say that I like how this software works.  It's got good voice recognition software and the use of pictures and the way it tests you to make sure you understand what's going on, allows users to build vocabulary quickly.Note:::There will be a portion of the population, like myself, that will absolutely need to have the system of conjugation written down for them to `see' the logic of it, but that doesn't really detract from the software in my opinion.What does detract is the \"beta\" feel of the administrative part of the software.  Installation and maintenance have been a royal pain in the tuckus.I think my husband described it best when he said:  `Their software is very tightly scripted, but not very adaptive.  If your system is at all different from what the Rosetta Stone programmers anticipated, you will on the phone with the help desk for considerable time.'  That said, their help desk was helpful.INSTALLATION:::  Installation wasn't all that smooth for us.  After we installed the software, it gave us a notice that we needed to upgrade our O/S (a new service pack) and a new version of the Rosetta Stone software's engine. Plus there was some difficulty getting the headphones working, but I can't recall now exactly where the problem lay.MAINTENANCE:::  Yes, who knew there was maintenance.True to form, everything was running exceedingly smoothly for my husband, myself, and my 10 year-old daughter UNTIL the pop-up of death appeared that demanded that it be allowed to install an update.  Being a cautious soul I tried to back out as I `didn't want an update thank you', but guess what.  The software would no longer work.  No more French learning without the update :(Well, since that was a no go, I allowed the  update.  And guess what.  No more French learning.  In fact, the update hosed things up for a good long while, at least until someone had time to call the help desk and spend a good hour fixing the problem.It was amazing how much information was needed to do this.  We had to give the tech not only the Rosetta Stone key, but also  everything about our computer including the clock rate. Go figure. I suppose they are adding to their database trying to narrow in on where the problems are coming from.In any case, it turned out that there was a hidden file that needed to be deleted.  This file told the system that the upgrade was in progress, when in fact it had failed.  There was also a problem that stemmed from the fact that we have different profiles on this particular computer.  One for adults, one for kids.  In the end though that was resolved as well.THE SKINNY:::You are probably surprised by the 4-Stars I've given this program.  But honestly I don't think there's anything that compares to the Rosetta Stone method of learning.My advice would be to only install this software on a newer machine and if possible not allow that computer to connect to the internet until you are ready to use the online features.  These, by the way, will only work with one profile.Pam T~mom/newish French student",

I have been through the entire course multiple times and found that I was able to put a DVD on \"French\" and actually understand much of what being said.

My computer is quite up to the task and so was I but I was never able to get that working. Even so, the parts of the course I was able to access were very enjoyable and enhanced my French skills.

First, the installation was simple.  I was surprised to find stickers for the keyboard for the special characters.  And, there are worksheets that you can print out for additional practice.  One thing that is not mentioned on here that I could find, is there are 2 versions of the software.  We have the homeschool version.I saw and heard her speaking French very soon after she started.  I thought that it might be a good idea for me not to depend on her in a foreign country, so I started learning also.  I don't think that I've heard one word of English and I am half way through this level.  Most of the lessons are self explanatory.  I have really enjoyed the lessons and feel like I could at least start to figure out what's going on when we get to France.Pros:-Easy to understand.-Builds on itself nicely.-Repetition to help remember.-Doesn't start at the alphabet & numbers like they do in schools.Cons:-Expensive!-The workbook is 100 pages long and must either be printed or the answers written on paper.-It has occasionally been a little tough to figure out what you're supposed to be doing.-It's not very fond of a light southern accent.-Maybe a little too much repetition for an adult.Ultimately, I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn a new language. People learn differently and maybe that is the issue that other adults are having with it.Now I just have to save my pennies (approx. 50000 of them) so I can get the other levels.",

I learned enough to figure out words in reading, but didn't excel much at the oral part.  I tried this item out for that.  The other one I had for review was the Spanish one.  I gave it one star less than this, though it is pretty much the same program.  I learned more with this kit than the Spanish one, since I took four years of Spanish in high school and retain a lot of it still.  I am still not sure about how to find how much the online lessons are once my trial period of three months that you get free with the kit is over. It is hard to find on the website.  I like the games and layout of the Rosetta Stone program and I am a visual learner and this helps me with the oral part as well.  I like to see as I speak, which is hard to do with audio programs.  This has audio CDs for the car, video games for my computer and online help once I get my French up to speed.  My only complaint about this program is that you can only install in on one computer, so I have one of these on my laptop and the Spanish one on my home computer, since it takes up a good chunk of memory.  I would like the option to put these on any new computers I buy years from now, but RS has a very limited use.  It's like buying a course.  If you have a computer you will use for 5-6 years, it is really worth it.  If you work at home in a field where you need to upgrade your computer more often, you might be disappointed that you can't put it on your new computer.  I wish RS would allow at least this to be installed on two computer, in case the computer you are using fails.This is like taking one semester of French, beginner level, in high school or college.  I learned about the same thing I did in the French course in college and it is less money to do it this way.I think if you are a visual learner, you will like this product.  There is a lot of debate that kids learn better this way, but I think adults can too.  Mind you, that this teaches you very basic French and not beyond present tense really.  Just like a college course.  I like that I can see the words and tend to repeat them better when I see a picture at the same time.  Or maybe I am just a child at heart!Note: I have been using this and another Rosetta Stone for several weeks now and the headset that comes with it has a microphone that isn't so good. Or maybe with use had become not so good. Both my boyfriend and I have trouble getting the microphone to register words we say, even if we say it correctly. For example, even simple Spanish words like Si and Hola get a negative signal even though I am saying it perfectly. I continue at the same volume about 5 times and then, it finally takes it. I wonder if it will become frustrating on high levels where you have to repeat back longer sentences. My Mac doesn't have an external mic, so I have no option but to use the headset and take it off to speak as loud as I can into the microphone. It doesn't seem to matter if I do their \"1,2,3,4,5\" test at regular voice, louder or softer. After having to repeat one word twenty times before they accept it, even though I know I am doing it right, tires me out!",

Trilingual;  What do you call a person who speaks two languages?  Bilingual; What do you call a person who speaks one language?  American.I have wanted to improve my language status for many years.  My High School Latin teacher said that after I learned Latin, the other romance languages would be easy.  I considered the other romance languages (Spanish, Portugese, Italian. Aragonese, Aromanian, Arpitan, Asturian, Corsican, Emiliano-Romagnolo, Friulan, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Lombard, Mirandese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Piedmontese, Romansh, Sardinian, Sicilian, Venetian and Walloon), only the major four (French, Spanish, Italian, and Portugese were attractive to me, but then I saw this offer from Rosetta Stone and I chose French.Learning French was easier than I thought.  Of course the grammar I learned in my four years studying Latin made French grammar easier.  Well, and I did get a French grammar text and a French dictionary, since Rosetta Level 1 is limited in grammar.  After a few months using the interactive program, I began to feel comfortable speaking the language.I was tempted to brag to my family that I now speak French, then I realized that I had yet to converse in French with another human.  Soon I remembered my years living in Germany.  I had studied German, but could not really have a meaningful conversation with a German.  When I said something in German, they would answer in English (somehow they knew I was an American).  Those who did not speak English (maybe one percent of those I encountered) used a different dialect, and I was back to using my German book and pointing to words.  The lesson for me is that now I must spend some time in France if I really want to learn the language.  Oh well, I can read French as long as people do not get technical.Recently I thought of a possible answer to the dilemma I have with my European friends.  I could learn to speak Walloon, Friulan, and Arpitan.  I am unlikely to encounter anyone who speaks those languages, so no one to question whether I really know it.  Then I will tell them I am \"quadri lingual.\".  Do you think that will work? . . . Neither do I.",

I have had a couple of minor glitches, but RS customer service was responsive.I understand the methodology. In a nutshell, I feel that even minimal information on verb tenses or sentence structure or article usage would be incredibly helpful. Fortunately, my Austrian friends are there to help me (although they seem to think I'm silly to try to learn German when they are happy to speak English to me when I visit!). One friend sent me to this [...] to help me understand. It was very early on in Level 1 that I was confused by all the endings added on without explanation. Yes, you may pick up the patterns at some point, but a bit of explanation would be easier.That said, there is so much repetition, you need not fear the next lesson. And it is pretty enjoyable on the whole. I grew up hearing a little bit of German/Yiddish, so the pronunciation has been easy for me. I am a bit fanatical about accents, so I want to get it right. I am bugged that occasionally the voices will differ during the lesson. Ex.: the pronunciation lessons for 'und' and 'fahrrad' make clear that you hit the D pretty much like a T; but when the female voice says 'fahrrad,' she says it like a D.  Same with 'und'--the male voice says it as a D in one phrase.It's hard to imagine becoming anywhere near fluent without the rules and such, but I'm reviewing Level 1, so that's not for me to say.The headset is very nice and solid. So why does each new level come with one?? What a waste! Offer the option of buying the software and using the headset we have.",

    "reviewText": "My husband bought me this for my birthday.  I used this for months, as I had German friends traveling to the US and wanted to be able to offer conversation in their native language.  This software fell short (by a long shot).  The pictures work well, but at times can be confusing.  Often, no matter how I spoke a phrase, it would tell me I'm incorrect, conversely, at times when I've been horribly off, I've gotten credit.  The software is easy to use, and reliable, but even receiving a response from their team is like pulling teeth. I had contacted them numerous times for explanations (there's no key or anything textual for me to use as reference other than an alphabet references, just pictures...and figuring those out can be a difficult task as well) and was given very generic responses that led me nowhere.  As the lessons went on, the language became more confusing.  There were articles and demonstratives that were extremely confusing, and I couldn't figure out if they were based on the object or gender/plurality of those speaking (nominative, etc).  I received no verification from Rosetta, simply referring to the dictionary reference, which was of no help. I even attended an online Q&A, which they glossed over my question without an answer! They quickly read it and basically, nonchalantly, referred back to the above, unhelpful reference I was given before. Given the amount you pay for this software, they should provide other pertinent lessons on what I've mentioned (it's an entire topic that could be lent to itself). I was constantly bombarded with emails and pop-ups trying to get me to buy more support or more software, yet I couldn't get anyone to answer my questions and often had to use Google Translate or a plain search on the internet. I think German is quite difficult for a native English speaker to grasp with just this software.  I would recommend this if you have a basic knowledge of a particular language, as it's good for brushing up.  But, for me (and for German), I would not recommend Rosetta Stone. It was much more helpful to do YouTube searches and speak to my German friend over Skype (though frustrating).",

The sequential software will come when I have completed each one of them.The hardware was fine and the headset isn't flimsy.  It's much better than any headphone or headset I bought for myself, but that doesn't mean it can't break or get glitches.  My only (tiny) hardware irk is that all the Audio companions is on a DVD data disc so I had to burn CDs in order to listen to this in my car.  (My iPod is barely used and stays at home.)I had no problems installing the software or getting my computer to recognize the headset.To quote myself in another comment:\"I own a 64-bit Windows Vista and I have separate speakers and headset apart from the headset. The only issue that I ran into is that when I installed the the Rosetta Stone software, it automatically defaults ALL sounds through the headset. I didn't realize this until I started playing my music and trying to video chat. This can be adjusted through Control Panel > Hardware & Sounds > Sound (Right-click this icon and create a shortcut onto your desktop!). In the sound control panel, there will be a \"Playback\" tab and a \"Recording\" tab. (Sorry XP, Win7, Snow Leopard, and all Mac users. Hopefully you get the gist.)\"Rosetta Stone works; but I am the type of learner where complete immersion, repetition, and activities work.  If you have access to Rosetta Online, I recommend the Bingo game and going through the stories.  When using Stories, first listen to it and try to visualize every said detail, then read it.  Doing this paired with the Audio has helped me tremendously.I do find problems with pronunciation. Some of my pronunciation errors are right, but there are a few (e.g. alt, Jahre, Bruder, Englisch) that I have to over-exaggerate certain (wrong sounding) noises to get it to accept. That is REALLY frustrating because I don't hear what I'm incorrectly saying.  What's also frustrating is that it'll accept many other words that I'm nowhere near to pronouncing correctly.  \"Uuuuuuh...\" is sometimes accepted! The pronunciation quirks pester me the most when using this program, but I can't say I run into them too much where it deters me from wanting to continue through the lessons.The Milestones at the end the four units are a bit intimidating especially if you don't use the online resources.  I am usually at a lost for what to say.  It's not obvious all the time.  In this situation, just remain silent.  The program will think there's an error with the microphone. When you have formed the sentence in your mind, continue with the activity.I never use this program without Google Translate opened next to it.  I don't use it to decipher whole sentences or phrases, just a couple words here and there.I don't lean too hard on Google for interpretation because after a while, a learner will see that German words do not correlate to just one meaning.  \"Sie\" can mean she, you, they, it and so on. The meaning depends on the overall sentence.  So it's important to try to think German and try not to interpret every word directly to English.  Rosetta Stone does a good job of giving visuals to let you think in German, but it does not explain any of the Grammar or word rules.  This is why I'm shopping for a German grammar book on Amazon.EXAMPLE: The more I research, the more I see how important it is to when to use \"sie\" and \"du\". Both mean \"you,\" but one is formal and good for strangers and the other is used among friends and family.  And my understanding is that depending on what \"you\" we use makes a difference on the spelling of other words in the same sentence.As someone has mentioned, there's no glossary of words in Rosetta Stone.  So when I want to double-check my spelling or the words I'm using, I have to use Google Translate.****CORRECTION UPDATE**** There is a document of words and phrases learned.  It's located on the CD under \"Documentation\". ****July 12****Overall, I am very pleased with this program and the progress that I am making.  The price is fair to me because it cost less than taking a semester course at my local college and I can access this as many times as I want... whenever I want. Rosetta Stone isn't totally complete with everything you need; and that's why I pair it with Google and other books and tools.  However, that doesn't mean that this doesn't work or isn't worth your investment.  If you understand that learning a language takes constant work and you are determined to teach yourself, buy this. This software is like a teacher.  And since I'm a student, it is up to me to do my homework.",

    "reviewText": "Every winter I tend to hibernate for a couple of months and when I do I always seem to pick up some obscure new interest; for a while there it was the idea that I'd learn to speak German. I'd seen the Rosetta Stone program demonstrated at a kiosk in Grand Central Terminal in NYC and it seemed to be a reasonable investment in getting to know how the program works for me while building some basic vocabulary. I like that it appeals to both my visual learning style and that you can increase the difficulty of pronunciation fluency.Level One covers some pretty basic stuff - things like \"newspaper\", \"egg\" and very easy/common words that you would likely learn early on if immersed in the culture you are studying, which is where I agree with the product description. The headset works with decent reliability but sometimes does not want to let me \"pass\" on a certain word no matter how many times I've said it or how accurate I think I am. I like that the program is based around pictures and spoken word. Since this is just level one I am not sure if this is the best way to learn to speak a new language entirely; for me, this \"flash card effect\" is a good way to learn and reinforce new vocabulary though.If you are planning on ordering more levels it might be advisable to check what deals are offered directly by the company, as they have offered some satisfaction guarantee or money back with certain packages. Either way you should have at least 30 days through Rosetta Stone or Amazon to see if this might be a good fit with no risk if it does not suit your learning style. I happen to think this program is worth a try.",

    "reviewText": "Rosetta Stone is almost miraculous and it has been stunningly effective in helping to master the German language.  I purchased the program a few years ago in preparation for a dream trip to Germany.  Within a very short time and with minimal effort on my part, I had more than mastered German, I was speaking it like a native.  I know this because so many people in Germany were shocked to learn I am an American and often refused to believe my accent was not Bavarian.  A few even insisted I was a native German and were adamant I must be joking.  When I told people that I was making my first visit to Germany and was from California, it was not unusual to see a shake of the head accompanied by a hearty laugh.  While there, I had no problem reading train schedules, maps, or even a bit of Goethe when a new German friend recommended him.  I especially enjoyed Wagner when I attended the Bayreuth Opera festival and am very glad indeed that I made that side trip.  Rosetta Stone has broadened my horizons and flung open so many cultural doors that I can not begin to recommend it enough.  Considering my desire to speak and read German simply began with my interest in World War II, it is truly wondrous how much more I have learned there is to German art and culture.  There is certainly more to this beautiful country than militarism and goosestepping parades of troops.  Once one masters the language, entirely new and magnificent vistas come into view.  The subtlety of the tongue introduces you to a warm and loving people who have been deeply misunderstood, often due to communication barriers and semantics.  Rosetta Stone offers the opportunity to all of us to grow closer to one another and to embrace all of humanity through language.  I am currently mastering Japanese and plan to move on to French shortly.  Perhaps the most significant thing I have learned through the wonder that is Rosetta Stone is that there are no limits to what I am capable of learning and to never again turn away from an intellectual challenge.  Even in middle age, it is both easy and fun to learn any new language and to become as fluent as you wish.  Already my Japanese neighbor has asked me how many years I lived in Japan as a child and if I went to school near Kyoto!",

If you get Rosetta Stone you will need to use a Greek Dictionary and have a tutor to help you interpret what is going on.  If you just wing it without, you will never really understand what you are doing.  You have photo's and sentences and words, but there is no explanation as to what Rosetta Stone is doing or why.  In my humble opinion, it would not be too difficult to make a better product than Rosetta Stone.  All you would need to do is offer some explanations as well as use a different format in some cases.  An advantage is found in the use of the text to speech verification.  However, as for the photos, it is a nifty idea, but the TV is a better visual medium then this, and it is no help at all. So photos alone are not the answer, although it is good idea.  Rosetta Stone also has various glitches.  For example, there will be a sentence, and you have to match it with a photo.  After you get the answer correct there is no way to *easily* check to see what was said in writing without going back where all the sentences are flashed off in the beginning.  They also use the same format for every language, I really question how committed they are to teaching the best way for each language.  I hear they throw in TV and other such things in Latin.There is a WIDE MARGIN for improvements here, so keep your eyes open for the next product, I know I will.  In the mean time get some Greek friends and purchase  Total Greek.  When you finished THEN I would say you can go back to Rosetta Stone.  For example to do it the other way around would be such a waste of time I cannot even make a compassion.",

You can repeat things as much as you want before moving on and the extra resources of the audio for when you're away from your computer and the mobile companion are fabulous extra practice. I just completed unit 1 and signed up for what they call a studio session, which is where you get to practice what you've been learning live with a real Greek person. I was really nervous but it was great. Now, I think the product is great, but you do have to be motivated. I'm a teacher and I know that my students don't always put in the time so they might remember the most current stuff but not the older material. You've got to keep up with it, review, do it every day, take notes, etc. If you do it passively, I'm not sure how much you're going to get out of it because when there's no English, you really have to remember, so do it on a regular basis.",

I learned Spanish through classrooms and textbooks, and although I am fluent, I occasionally get this frustrated feeling like I'm missing a piece, like having skipped a page in a novel but not knowing which page. I learned American Sign Language in a totally natural environment, by contrast, and I feel as at home in ASL as I do in English (my first language). This program feels a lot more like my ASL learning experience than my Spanish experience.I got it to learn as much Greek as possible in about six months, before I go to Greece. I just cracked it open a few days ago, and already I am speaking in full sentences. Granted, they are guided sentences, but I have already pieced together quite a few novel sentences using the vocabulary and grammar I have already picked up. I'm impressed, and I know enough about language learning that being impressed by a piece of software is a pretty big statement for me.Initially I thought I would just learn the absolute basics, enough to survive Greece by myself without an interpreter. But I'm only on level 1, unit 1, lesson 3, and I already see that I am going to learn (and retain) a lot more than survival Greek. I haven't peeked ahead at level two yet, but, judging by how much is packed into the first three lessons, I would guess that each level is superior to an entire semester of a college class, at roughly a third of the price.My only wish so far is that it came with a very basic book of grammar and spelling rules. I do think the program is well-designed, providing careful contrast in each phrase/sentence so that you can figure out the rules as you go, which is the most natural way of doing it. But it would be nice to have a book to go to just for the sake of verifying my success at cracking the code. Although it's cheaper than college, it's still pricey, so I would think they could afford to throw in a few simple guides to grammar and phonetics.",

I did have a very small vocabulary already of some Hebrew words and phrases before I bought this.  In all I would say I knew about 100 words, and short phrases such as asking someone how they are, and I did learn how to tell someone that I did not speak Hebrew and ask if they spoke English.  Very basic, but still maybe more than a lot of people getting this program.So here is what I do not like about it.  I understand the importance of immersion, and there is not a speck of English in these lessons, and that is the problem, because no English also means no written English as well.  When pictures are put up you will hear the Hebrew word for it, and it will also be spelled using the Hebrew Alphabet, which of course means nothing to me, or to you if you don't know Hebrew, you obviously don't know the Alphabet.  It would be nice if they had a phonetic spelling of the words in English (like the Hebrew-English phrase books that I own).  I find this to be a big help, being able to read the word helps me to remember and associate the picture to the word, and also helps with pronouncing it.To be honest, I have gotten more useful Hebrew out of the Pimsleur series of introductory Hebrew.  With that I can already speak complete sentences and have small conversations, and order in restaurants etc, and those I can listen to in the car, or at the gym and they cost much less.  As you can see between Rosetta, Pimsleur, and my phrase books, I have taken learning Hebrew pretty seriously, and have invested a good amount on it.  I won't say that I have not gotten anything out of Rosetta Stone, but it is not as magical as the adds that you may have seen make it out to be, and again, I think this may pertain to languages where the alphabet and the characters are so different from English.The last criticism that I have is the included audio files that you get with it that you can download to iTunes.  I was really excited about that until I played them.  All they have is someone saying the Hebrew words from the lessons on them.  Not even the English word first, then the Hebrew word so that you know what it is.  It is like listening to a Hebrew movie or TV show with your eyes closed.  You have no idea what the word means if you don't already know it.  And if you have heard the word before but are not 100% sure on what it is, there is nothing to remind you, either you know it, or you don't, and that is confusing and frustrating.  I don't know how anyone could find that useful.  After about 15 minutes of listening and realizing this I didn't even bother listening to another, and went right back to my Pimsleur cd's.Everyone learns differently, so what is not helpful for me, may be fine for you, but if you think this type of immersion learning is right for you, then go for it, because if you can learn that way, then I think you'd be rocking Hebrew in no time.",

It kept saying I needed to update something and I did and then it wouldn't kick it in automatically afterwards...had to do this 3 times before it finally decided to do what it was supposed to do. I also couldn't find the files right away...just weird.But once it was setup and I was rolling with the program...WOW. This is awesome. And it's addictive, which is what you need when you have to immerse yourself in something. With language, you won't get it unless you are just doing it all of the time. And with this program, well, it's been 2 hours and I am reluctantly going to bed now because I have to get up in 6 hours.Also, for the person who complained about the Hebrew and it not having things spelled out so we can sound them out... Ok, maybe I am just good at this, but I am picking up how to read in Hebrew after 2 hours. I mean, you start to notice patterns in letters and sounds. Just pay attention to the Hebrew spellings when you hear the sounds. Plus, the program DOES teach you to read after a while.Overall, this program is wonderful and I am really excited! I believe if I stick with this, I WILL learn Hebrew.",

    "reviewText": "Amazon isn't very clear which version this is, exactly. I believe it's the Total-e version, but I'm not sure by how it's worded on this site today (6/28/11).I purchased my copy in August 2010, so I think it may be the previous version. I do not have Total-e.With all that said, I would like to review the software I do have, which I can confirm does match very closely with the description of the software on this page.It is, in a word, EXCELLENT. There are some things about it that are hard to understand, but I honestly don't know how a software program for learning this difficult language could be any better than what Rosetta Stone's (RS) produced.The previous reviewer was complaining that this software is inadequate, because you don't know how to read the script. That is true initially, but leads me to believe that he didn't go very far in the software, because they DO start to teach you to read devanagari within the first unit of level one. It is a fair criticism from the previous reviewer that the foundation they offer is different from what you'd expect. I'm accustomed to learning tourism-friendly phrases first, like to ask where the train station is, etc. RS is NOT like that at all.I knew only the words for some food dishes and for water in Hindi before I started this software, and I could not read a single character in the devanagari syllabary. I was starting from nothing. I have used the Spanish software from RS, and agree that it is to an English speakers definite advantage that Spanish uses the same alphabet we use. However, it is MUCH more complicated to craft a language learning software program in a totally different script. Now that I've spent several months off and on with the program, I appreciate their approach. It would be way too overwhelming to try to learn devanagari first, and then start speaking. 99% of people would quit, because the syllabary is so large and so different from our alphabet.Here is what RS does: They show you pictures, and you hear native speakers talking. You can't read what it says, so you must listen closely. The first unit of level one was tough, I'm not gonna lie. I had to do it a couple of times before I got the hang of it. Then, I just took off. I spent probably 3 or 4 hours with the software on the first day, and by the end of that day, I was able to say \"the girl is eating rice\". Awesome! I think being able to form a simple sentence so quickly helped keep me engaged and confident, which = motivated.True, it does seem to start you off speaking phrases that are not what you commonly find in language learning resources. I'm only a little more than halfway through level one (because I've been going sporadically, have been redoing sections, etc), and I still haven't learned how to say goodbye or thank you. However, I can ask what something is, describe activities that people are doing, say that \"the woman is reading her newspaper,\" \"the man is wearing his coat,\" \"one black cat is under the table,\" and other such phrases that took me MUCH longer to learn using other language learning techniques. I studied Spanish for two years in high school, and never learned how to say these kinds of sentences.They introduce the characters of the devanagari syllabary slowly. I probably know about 20-25 of them by now. As I mentioned earlier, I'm glad they're going slowly, or else I would get frustrated and bored.The real beauty of RS is that you quickly get to the point where the words just roll off your tongue, unlike when you study a language in a classroom setting and get good at taking tests, but end up tongue tied, because you haven't learned how to have a conversation. RS's emphasis on what they call \"dynamic immersion\" is so right on the mark. I cannot say enough good things about their approach to language learning.The software is expensive. But guess what? So are classes, and so is going to another country for an immersion at a language school. If you total up the cost of taking language classes at a community college or going to Mexico or Guatemala to study Spanish (for example), this is BY FAR the best value for your money. Why? Because you can return to it at any time. You can practice in the middle of the night, if you want. If you're shy about making mistakes (like me), it doesn't matter, because you're talking to a computer, and you can always redo a lesson for a better score!If you get this software, one tip I have is to ask for help from a native speaker, if you know anyone. If not, then use their Total-e options. I've needed to ask my boyfriend a few questions, and I'm lucky I have him around as a resource, so I didn't need to get or use Total-e.",

Because Pimsleur does not use writing in the earlier lessons, (that is a good decision for languages that use our alphabet because we need to learn the sounds and not pronounce the letters as they are in our language.) But, Hindi used a completely different set of characters that are very important to the speaker. So, we learn the pronunciation and sounds, and Rosetta Stone for the other needed parts.We have also used Pimsleur for German and Russian and there have no need for Rosetta Stone.We were using this program to work with the script. It was version 4, which Rosetta Stone says can be put on two computers for five students in a family. That is not true. Because of my eyesight I needed to use a larger screen so I tried to put it on a second computer. It would not activate. I had to delete it from the laptop it was on before I could change it.When I deleted it from the laptop it gave me a set of two numbers, one was the Activation Key, which I already had, and another was the delete number. You had to send both Rosetta Stone before you could activate the program on the exchange computer. Due to a glitch, (in the computer world - one that I have been in since 1979 - glitches happen) and I lost the delete number. I tried to contact Rosetta Stone and work things out so that I could use the program on my larger screen.EDIT: The product now works on both computers. They must have straightened it out in house, but they did not communicate this with me, so I found out by accident. Rosetta Stone is a viable help to Pimsleur since it does have pictures with the words and helps one to visualize certain things. They also help with the Hindi phonetic system and, since that is so different than the Western Alphabet, the help is appreciated. The product is fine, a bit overpriced, but a viable addition to Pimsleur for Hindi. I would not need it for something like German. I can give it two stars now. I would give it three but for the lack of communication with their customers.",

Having tried the Rosetta Stone method, I cannot go back to the other ways.  It works.The Rosetta Stone method breaks down and simplifies language learning more intuitively than other programs and methods I've tried.  It does not emphasize grammar rules or vocabulary lists.  Rather, it provides an environment where you learn by associating words with images.  This curriculum follows some of the basic principles in many immersion education programs, and mimics the way language is taught to a small child.  In my opinion and experience, this association method helps to increase retention, and makes learning much more intuitive.This package has a very good speech recognition system integrated into the program.  This helps to improve the learning process, since it gives feedback on accent and pronunciation, and improves your ability to speak as well.What I liked:Interactive software - I was able to apply what I learned after each lesson.It also comes with a headset+microphone to help with the pronounciation.  BIG PLUS!Audio companion - I loaded up these lessons on my MPT3 player and I was able to practice while driving to and from work.Online Lessons - I liked the practice sessions, and having native Italian speakers is a huge plus.I was able to perfect my pronunciation with this set.  There is an online community that you can join and participate with others online.  It's a very nice addition, and something that seems exclusive to Rosetta.  However, this feature is only available without extra cost for 3 months, after this trial period it is $25/month, or $149 for 15 months.  I finished the software lessons, went through it again, and then used the online feature.What I didn't like:My only issue is the price.  It is very expensive!  In some sense, you get what you pay for, and with this you pay a premium.  However, if you want to learn Italian on your own time, and you can afford it, I highly recommend the Rosetta Stone.",

He would come to me daily trying out his Italian on me and he sounded very good!I've gone through a lot of the program. It's laid out quite nicely and easy to follow. I love that the use of photos is used so much in this program, because both my son and I are visual learners. But if you're an audio learner, there's plenty of that too!!Anyway, love these Rosetta Stone programs. We completed Spanish last year and had the same experience with that!!

    "reviewText": "Never having studied Italian before, and never having used Rosetta Stone before, I was definitely excited to give it a go and find out what all the hype was about.I went through the whole lesson over the course of a couple of months, spending only about a day or two a week on it.In the end, I think it was a smart system, one that has specific advantages, but also marked disadvantages.POSITIVES:+++ IMMERSION TECHNIQUE -there is no English.  you will only see pictures and hear Italian.  This means you'll learn more effectively, as your brain is forced to make certain connections on its own.  Additionally, when you see pictures, for example, of a \"male\", the picture will be different each time: one time might be a young boy, and then it might be an old man, then a young man, and so on... and the first time you see the picture you might think it is a boy, but when the second picture pops up you realize that the word must mean something else, and you relate the two, and pick the commonality.  Anyway, this is a hard example, and it is simpler than this, but the idea is that you see different pictures representing each word, each time.++ WELL DESIGNED/VARIED -there are multiple modules which are scattered throughout -listening & comprehension, reading, pronunciation, typing, and so on.  It is impressive.++ GOOD REVIEWS -when I finished a section I was happy to find out that many of the concepts came back --not right away, but later when they weren't the freshest in my mind-- this meant I had to remember it, and basically memorized it through this recall.  I thought Rosetta Stone did a great job bringing up concepts and reminding me of the concepts later on.  I did not feel the need to review previous lessons...++ PAINLESS.  This system is about as fun (can I say that?) and as painless as a computer aided language learning system can get.NEGATIVES:--- PRICE, PRICE, PRICE -for most people the $200 cost for a single lesson (less as you buy more modules) is really too high.  Yes I know these things cost money, and I know they are better than other systems, but the pricing suggests that they are worried you won't like it, and you'll feel pressured to continue because you spent so much, OR, they are trying to convince you to pay only a few hundred more to get the whole set.  I'd argue they'd be better off dropping the price in half for the first module, and then I'd recommend it more.  (And give me some sort of discount if I buy lesson 2 separately.  I am not going to buy multiple modules without buying the first one, and testing it out.  $500 for the set is too much of a committment without giving it a shot first.)- READING EXERCISES ARE BUGGY SOMETIMES -I have spent 5 minutes (unsuccessfully) on several sections where I am supposed to say just one syllable, and the voice recognition system fails.  I mean, I KNOW what I am hearing, I have studied 4 languages, have good pronunciation, and I can't for the life of me get the computer to believe I said \"PO\" (for example) instead of something unrecognizable.  It was very frustrating, as I tried to enunciate it every way imaginable, with no luck.  Yet, when It was a multi-syllabic word (with the same syllable) the computer had no problem.- NO DICTIONARY -yes, I know this isn't part of their system, but it would have been nice to have a dictionary so that I could learn some additional words on my own.  (Sometimes you just don't want to wait to lesson 5 to learn numbers, for example...)But probably the biggest criticism is that this program is no substitute for classroom participation.  (Yes, I know that there are some online modules that you can pay more for, but I wasn't interested in paying any more...)My wife was taking classroom Italian at the same time I was doing this system, and we would compare experiences.  One thing I noticed is that the \"putting-sentences-together-on-my-own-and-saying-them\" part of Rosetta Stone, was one of the weaker sections.  She, on the other hand, got many opportunities to practice.  Mine was more about listening and comprehension.Overall, if classroom Italian really isn't an option for you, because you don't have the time or you just don't like classrooms, AND you have a lot of money to spend, then I'd say this is a good deal.  (If I were forced to move overseas I would definitely invest in the system.)But, if you are a starving student, then you're better off looking for other books and CDs from the library before trying this system.Recommended, but with reservations.",

This is most assuredly the best program I've used to learn Italian. I have the older version too, and I like the new audio-visual matching; it's different from the older version and moves a lot faster.With this version, you can move at your own pace a lot easier, and see your mistakes sooner, which is helpful.Not only does this have visual learning, and learning by audio, but also by speaking, and comparing your pronunciation to that of a native speaker, which I think is the most helpful part of the software. The way the teaching of the language is set up, is I believe, the closest to learning it naturally with native speakers. I highly recommend this software...grazie!",

    "reviewText": "As a homeschooling mother who discusses with other home educating parents how to teach certain subjects, foreign language is one of the trickier topics to deal with; Rosetta Stone (RS) has been at the top of the list of foreign language instruction software since for so long it and it has been known as being the best software option on the market.Homeschooling parents typically have three options for teaching foreign language: 1) if they are a fluent speaker they can teach it directly, often using a textbook curriculum for the structure; 2) use computer software like RS for child-led learning; or 3) take an online class supported by a teacher.A major downside is RS lacks a strong grammar component; its strength is getting a person to have oral fluency. I am hearing stories from other homeschoolers who have used RS for multiple years and who were happy with RS, that they are too lacking in grammar to perform well on the SAT II test (the SAT subject test is now required by some colleges for admission), so they are suddenly unhappy with RS but it's too late to do anything about it. I want to learn from those people's mistakes! If you desire a stronger grammar component, before buying RS you should look into a newer productFluenz Italian 1 with supplemental Audio CD and Podcastswhich seems just like RS but with more grammar (and is similarly priced).Also if you are a homeschooling parent you should know there is a \"RSFluenz Italian 1+2 with supplemental Audio CDs and Podcastshomeschool package\" (see the RS website for info), which may be better than this `standard' product for your homeschool.--RS was easy to install, we had no problem getting it started on our Windows PC. There was some confusion over activating the online account, which is free for 90 days only, which we wound up not using anyway, as the base lessons were enough. We misunderstood the directions and thought we HAD to register online to start using it, but that doesn't seem to be correct.To test RS I used it, as did both of my homeschooled kids (aged 10 and 13). The only system glitch we have sometimes was the headset would not activate sometimes, when switching between users who attempt to use RS right after someone else used it. The fix that works is rebooting the PC.The program prompts the user to speak into the headset and it checks the accuracy. One of my kids (a newbie to learning foreign language) seems to have a problem and he blames the headset or the program for hearing him wrong but in RS's defense when I listen to the sample and then what my son is saying I detect a minor intonation error on my son's part or the emphasis part of the word is not being emphasized strongly enough, so the problem is my SON not the system. My other son has this problem once in a while only. I have not experienced this myself as after years of taking French in public school and college I have trained my ear to listen very carefully and also keep telling myself to not use Standard English speaking patterns (my son keeps overriding the Italian and inserting a more English language sound). I keep emphasizing to my sons to watch the voice recognition graph so they can see where there is a problem (it's a pretty cool feature). I mention this as perhaps other users may have this issue and might think the voice recognition software is faulty when really it is the user!This product is marketed to adults not just children. As an adult learner who formerly learned in a very different way this RS method of learning felt odd to me. I wanted to see things written out that I could look at (I'm a strong visual-text learner). Don't laugh but it took me a while to figure out what I was saying, not realizing for example that in Italian there is a pronoun for multiple females as \"they\". It was a bit odd to jump right in learning multiple pronouns that we don't use in English and also to use the verb conjugations without seeing anything in writing to explain it. I was having memory flashbacks of my school's French textbook that had the nice list of conjugations so I could read it written out while I was reciting it orally to help cement it in my mind. This way of learning the pronoun and verb when looking at just a color photo of the scene being referenced is so different for me, however it appeals to people who have a stronger sense of visual-image learning or for auditory learners. I still feel I need some kind of rule list to see in front of me, I found it hard to both learn the content and think to try to figure out the rules myself right in the middle of the lessons. For example, there is no direct teaching of which noun is feminine versus masculine and how that affects both the ending of the noun and the choice of verb to use with it. I had to figure out that `a' at the end is typically feminine and that `o' is typically masculine. I only knew about the existence of gender differences for non-living things from my former French classes; to my English speaking kids this is all new and is being taught without a basic, direct explanation. The RS method goes all the way back to how babies and toddlers learn to speak a native language and teaches it that way. (I think I will look for a supplemental book to supply this information.)My kids are flying through the lessons and really love it. To them it doesn't feel like work, they find it fun. As the program goes on there is more of a written component using the keyboard to type in material.The system is easy to use and I like the way it keeps a score and how you can't progress past certain points without getting a certain high score. It is easy to navigate through the menu in order to re-do selected lessons.We have been using Rosetta Stone Italian I for about two months and enjoy it. As a homeschooling family, if we were to purchase Rosetta Stone new I'd purchase the homeschool package not the standard package. I also would seriously consider usingFluenz Italian 1 with supplemental Audio CD and Podcastsinstead of Rosetta Stone for a stronger grammar element, but I've not been able to see Fluenz in real life yet (there are online video samples to view on Amazon.com though).  I'm sorry that I can't do a comparison between the two.",

    "reviewText": "So reads a lofty promise on the box of Rosetta Stone's Level 1 \"Italiano\" course. \"Do those things actually work?\" is the question most people ask us when they hear we have one. You know, they actually do. From my dyslexic sister to my stroke-victim mother, Rosetta Stone meets the challenges of teaching a wide range of people and at a wide range of natural ability.My personal failure to learn a foreign language is legendary. I took years of both high school and college Spanish--can't speak it. I got all the way to intermediate American Sign Language with college courses--can't get past spelling my name. I have failed at Korean, German, and French with equal aplomb. So as someone who has used tapes, CDs, computer programs, traditional school-room methods and real live people willing to teach me, let me say with some authority that Rosetta Stone is not only the best language learning device I have ever seen it is the only way I would ever recommend learning a foreign language outside of parachuting into a foreign country and stumbling around until you figure out what people are trying to tell you (otherwise known as \"total immersion\"). The lessons are challenging without being frustrating, the method is entertaining on a certain level, and the results immediate and noticeable.I like learning and I liked school, so I didn't mind working my way through the program. The real surprise was my little sister. She is severely dyslexic and absolutely hated most of her school life. She took to this like I couldn't believe, coming over to my house just for her \"lessons\" and sitting for hours quietly working through the program. She's rarely shown such devotion to learning and certainly not on her own free time. I also plan to set up an account for my mother, who had a series of strokes a few years back and is on disability. She could never learn a language in a classroom or by a rote memorization method (she can't remember what she did an hour ago) but she could learn this. I have never come across a learning program that works in the face of so many different kinds of obstacles.Weak spots are minor and few. The microphone included with the set doesn't always pick up voice correctly (for the amount they charge they should use a top-quality mike). The \"games\" in the program are tedious and have a thrown-together-at-the-last-moment-feel. I did not use the online functions because I really really detest the current trend of nickel and diming people to death with \"subscriptions\" for every little thing. If you shell out hundreds of dollars you should get all you need and you should own it clear and outright. But if you don't mind paying for a subscription when your free two months runs out this would not be a demerit. I wanted to review the program without the online functions for those that would not/could not use them, and I think the set is perfectly adequate as is.For homeschooled kids, children with learning disabilities, baby-boomers looking to keep their minds sharp, those planning an extended vacation, of if you just want to converse with the cute Italian guy at who works at the grocery store, Rosetta Stone is worth the money. Set up is easy and you're off and running in under ten minutes. Side effects include cravings for pasta and a desire to plan a trip to Lake Como.  I wonder if George Clooney has one of these?GRADE: A, or 4.5 stars rounded up to 5 for Amazon purposes.",

    "reviewText": "I've always found learning a new language to be a huge challenge. Never was able to get past the bare basics in high school language classes (German) and, despite the fact that both my parents were born and raised in Italy, I've never been able to get much traction in Italian either.The Rosetta Stone software, however, is making a difference. No, I can't say that after using the software for a week that I'm fluent in Italian, but I am making progress. It's a very comfortable way to learn the language, especially since it's self-paced and offers tools (the headset/microphone) to help out with pronunciation, a particular stumbling block for me. Since I'm so slow at picking up a language (and self-conscious about it), I'm finding this type of robust, immersive self-study to be far more effective than classroom learning.A minor nit to pick -- I wish the headset quality was a bit better since it's such an important tool in the process. It's adequate, but given the price tag for the product, better sound quality and usage comfort would be welcomed.This is only Level 1 Italian, so the language skills taught are just the basics. Think of it as a way to get your feet wet with a new language. If you're serious about becoming fluent in Italian or looking for more than just the ability to \"try on\" a new language, then you'll want to get the advanced versions (unfortunately, at a much higher cost).It is a very fun way to learn a language. If you're willing to put in the time, it does produce results.",

    "reviewText": "Overall I've always wanted to learn Italian and tried using the Pimsleur format series (which are recorded lessons), which is very good but as it doesn't give you active feedback you aren't sure where you stand.  In particular this is the case with pronunciation, as it's difficult to ensure you're saying things properly.  The Rosetta stone format helps immensely with this is as it provides active feedback with its microphone and headset.  I found this an important aspect because it keeps me motivated to continue practicing day in and out AND I'm ensured my practicing is proper.  Without active feedback, it's like learning to play a musical instrument without having anyone listen to you play - you may THINK you're playing well but really, you aren't, so the first time you try to perform, you'll get a lot of strange looks.  No different here.Downsides?  Need some fairly decent computing power to get this running.  I wouldn't touch it on anything less than a modern dual core.The level 1 is far too basic for anyone to just stop there.  One needs to continue onwards to at least level 5 to gain any noticeable appreciation in skills.  I know most will shy away from the higher levels because they cost so much.  It's hard for most people to push the button for a $400 software package these days.  Then again, you need to compare to getting professional lessons which will definitely cost you more.

It immediately asked if I wanted to update after I installed.  It was about a 4 MB update and downloaded/installed quickly.  Need admin privileges to install software.  Total install time with level 1 language pack was maybe 20 minutes or less (there is a lot of data copied to the PC).Launching the software was straightforward and launching into the first lesson was easy.  The only issue I had was getting the included microphone/headset to work right.  It kept telling me to say \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\" into the microphone, but it kept saying it couldn't configure the microphone.  I finally made some random noise into the mic and it worked fine.  In the lessons the mic worked fine.In the first lesson it was obvious what needed to be done.  I was slightly disappointed that the headset headphones did not play the audio, and instead the computer speakers played the audio, so why do I need a headset for just the microphone?  Oh well, no big deal, just different.I did the first lesson with my 5 year old son, and he enjoyed it a great deal too.  He quickly picked up what he needed to do for each lesson, but as a downside many of the lessons show only four pictures, so you can just start clicking on boxes until you get it right (an issue for my son).One thing I appreciated is the first lesson had absolutely no English.  It was only images and Italian words and speaking.  This is a better way to learn to make the association of the foreign word to the object instead of translating it in your head through your native tongue first.Maybe being level 1 it is easier on me, but I found I could be pretty far off in pronunciation and it would still accept my spoken words.  However, it is still nice to have some feedback if what your saying is close to correct, and this software provides that.I think this software is excellent, but the price of entry is high.  However, how much would it cost to take a foreign language class?  The textbook would probably cost at least 1/3rd what this software would cost.  So given the high price, I still think this is a good buy if you are a good solo learner.  Great for those who don't have time to take an instructor lead course.",

I am not new to the Italian language, and obtained the product as a refresher, so I cannot say whether the 'total immersion' method would be effective for myself or universally. Second, I am a Vine reviewer, and had intended to order levels 1-5, but the last copy was gone by the time I'd selected my mailing address. Level 1 is much too elementary, even as a 'brush up', for one with previous knowledge of Italian.Nonetheless, I believe anyone using Rosetta Stone should find it to be stimulating and fun, as well as informative. The various exercises, capacity for interaction, and games transform what could be tedious into what I'm sure many will find a constant treat.Allowing for that the vocabulary at this level is not new to me, I must say that, since my memory is more visual than audio, and I find studying vocabulary in books to be helpful, I cannot say whether I could have picked up much had I depended only on this method.

    "reviewText": "I had reviewed a couple years back Rosetta Stone's V3 software.  Little has changed at the core of the learning system, which is by far and away a good thing.  If you're not familiar with how this program works, it is truly the most \"natural\" way to learn a language.Let me explain (if you do know how this works skip to the next paragraph for updates on the new features).  This program does the best it can to mimic a child-like learning environment, which is what everyone needs to learn.  I really mean it.  Think of it this way: how do children learn a language?  They imitate what they hear and see, right?  They do not have a concept early on of memorization.  Children do not memorize language, grammar, vocabulary, sentences, etc...they repeat what they hear, associate what they hear with what they see, and make mistakes as they go, slowly correcting themselves with guidance and observation and trial and error.  This program does the same thing, but with you, an adult (or so I presume for most readers of this review).  It shows you a picture, associates the word visually, and then through audition.  You then practice back by seeing, choosing, saying the words that you have learned.  You'll make mistakes, but will self-correct with this program just like a child would.  Practice will not make perfect, only permanent.  Hence, when you do practice, make sure to do it slowly and really understand what it is that you're saying, seeing, and hearing; this program makes it much easier than reading a book alone, or just listening to audio cassettes; it's truly an all-encompassing programs.  Memorization and just repetition is NOT the way to learn a language, and friend of mine who did this for 4 years (think Highschool) cannot speak a single sentence even though they were A students.  I, having been blessed with a teacher who forced us to live the language by all the ways that a mind can comprehend it, never memorized the language, and can speak it very well now (no medical terms, but good `ol conversation and banter).So, what's new here compared to V3?  I was pleasantly surprised that at least one of my previous suggestions in a previous review was taken seriously.  I had mentioned the need for you to practice with native speakers in order to really get the hang of a language.  And now, you get this chance with a short free trial.  I had also mentioned in the old review to make learning the language fun, as anything that's fun is instantly remembered for the long term better as we all know.  Rosetta Stone included games to play and enjoy.  I'm very happy that this company really listens to its customers and updates its products, instead of sticking to its guns thinking they figured everything out.  Two thumbs up for that.I HAVE NOT (reason forthcoming), yet tried the online sessions with the native speakers.  There's a reason for this, and I really hope you take note of this before purchasing this product.  First, I don't recommend purchasing level 1 of this language (and logically of any).  I want you to ask yourself why you want to learn this language?  To learn how to say \"pants\" and barely speak or comprehend a sentence, or to actually learn to have some minimal conversational skill?  I'm going to take a wild guess and say you fit into the latter category.  It makes no sense to me to \"try\" out learning a language and barely learn anything for such an EXPENSIVE program!  Unless you have money to burn skip buying the incomplete set, please.  I recommend that if you are REALLY truly serious about getting the hang of a language to a minimally conversational degree with just the software then get the entire set and save yourself money in the long-run (quite a bit I might add).  Then use the online native speakers to help you master your conversational abilities.  BUT, I emphasize, DO NOT waste your money activating your free trial of the native speaker engagement sessions (and games) until you have complete the entire program.  Why in the world would you take precious time and money to do such a thing when you'll just be able to spit back the names of colors and buildings back to one another?  Wait until you get semi-coherent and put your hard earned dollars to work only then, after mastering the program.  This is precisely why I haven't activated the free trial yet, I want to really get the hang of at least the portion of the program I got to review until I speak to a native speaker.",

It is a slow process, but rewarding as you go along so you will want to learn more. Grammar rules are introduced very slowly so you learn them well and vocabulary is limited for those who desire to learn Italian fluently. This software does however provide you with a solid foundation that will allow you to use proper grammar and create proper sentence structure. Don't expect to know how to say \"caterpillar\" or \"kaleidoscope\" because if you do then you are expecting the impossible. If you finish the software and buy a vocabulary book, you will be in good shape. My best advice is to go on the rosetta stone website and try the interactive demo. It is the first few lessons of the first level. Everybody learns differently, so I can tell you that if the program works great for 20 minutes, it will continue to work for another 20 thousand. I actually received a trial CD in the mail a couple years ago and that was what inspired me to buy the full version. I was that impressed. Within five minutes, I learned (and retained) more than I ever learned in the past with audio CDs and traditional classes. Give it a shot and let me know if you agree too.",

Activation required 2 tries, but it appears the code is only valid for 3 months so I suspect online access may be terminated after 3 months but the software should still continue to work.The pace starts off slow, but within the early portion of Unit 1, the vocabulary starts to pick up rather quickly. Since I am not a language expert, I had a hard time keeping up initially because different tenses of words, or the plural, were thrown in. Rosetta Stone relies on photographs to help you out, which is quite useful but I could not get a good grasp of the language to actually use it in normal speech. Once you start getting used to the phrases, the software begins to kick it up by throwing in more words. Unfortunately, like other users, the phrases are too simple for use in everyday conversation.The Level 1 kit includes a USB headset with a microphone to allow you to speak the phrases using the built-in speech recognition. This helps with pronunciation, although I found that it will disable my main audio and I have to switch back and forth. This isn't a big deal for most people, and there's no easy workaround.The box advertises that many Government agencies use Rosetta Stone, like the US Army and State Department. There certainly is value in the Rosetta Stone software helping Soldiers or agents learn a foreign language in the shortest time possible, but I felt it should focus on more useful phrases. 45 minutes of repeating various forms of \"Boys eating\", or \"girls running\" are not phrases that have much tactical value when you're visiting or operating in a different country.Overall: 4/5 stars",

    "reviewText": "I was prepared to be disappointed with Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1, the first Rosetta Stone I've tried.  It was the voice recognition I was leery of. Though I've studied two languages through classes, I have no aptitude for speaking languages at all. The languages I'm most familiar with are the Teutonic/Germanic gutteral sounding languages; I have such problems with the romance languages. I married into a Portuguese-American family and they still howl with laughter when, after 21 years, I attempt the language.In addition, I've broken my ear drums a couple times, and have suffered loss of hearing as a result (compounded, could be, by age!).I am very happy to say that I have had no problem hearing or understanding the Rosetta program.  The included headphone/microphone combo fits comfortably and I forget it's on while going through a lesson. In addition, I've only had a couple times where I had to repeat a phrase because it was so off-base the voice recognition program didn't think it would pass as Italian. Now, granted, this may be because the bar is set really low for how authentically I speak Italian; but I would think that with a program teaching Italian as a second language, it would have to be. For most people, it isn't teaching you how to pass as Italian, it's teaching you how to pass IN Italian. And, if the voice recognition program was too fussy, I would get discouraged and just throw it away.Lessons start out with pronunciation, one syllable at a time, spoken and written.  Then vocabulary, spoken and written. Then phrases.  Total immersion, everything is shown on the screen in Italian and spoken in the program in Italian. Occasionally, you have to type in the answer to a question, rather than say the answer.  Everything is accompanied by photos. So your learning is reinforced in three ways:  you hear the phrase spoken, you see the phrase written, and you see a photo illustrating each phrase (a boy running, boys running).  In later lessons you dive into conversations with full sentences.Your Main Menu shows you which lessons you've completed. Based on that, you can access Rosetta Studio, which is practice with real people. Your main menu will tell you if any Rosetta Studio sessions are available at any point in time. You schedule a session and you and other students take part in a session lead by a native Italian speaker.You get a two-disc CD set for additional practice when you're not on the computer. I have used mine in the car, only occasionally feeling silly for \"talking to myself\". There's no voice recognition, of course. You are only repeating what is said on the CD.  The CD is divided into the same chapters as in the computer program, and each chapter starts with pronunciation, then vocabulary and phrases. Good reinforcement, though, I have to concentrate so hard on what is being said on the CD, that it's a little distracting for driving.If you have an iPhone or another iTouch device, you can download a mini-version of the computer program, including photos. I haven't tried that as my phone is a dinosaur.Included with your program is three months access to Rosetta World OnLine. I haven't tried this yet. From what I understand, after you've completed each chapter on the computer program, you are told how many games, stories and activities are available to you on the OnLine center. You can play individual games, or games with other players (learners) logged in, or with a native Italian speaker. Unfortunately, Rosetta World OnLine is only available 8am - 8 pm for me in Pacific Standard Time zone.  Many times I've sat down at the computer after the kids are in bed, and then it's too late.  If you're in the Eastern U.S., it's available from 11 am to 11 pm. After the three month introductory offer is over, you pay a fee, but I actually can't find what the fee will be.Incidentally, Rosetta Stone offers a six-month unconditional money-back gurantee, but according to their website, you have to order it direct from Rosetta Stone. I only checked the price for Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 and as of writing this review, the price is the same as the price on amazon.I am using this program on a PC XP with no problems.",

Special characters are handled intuitively when writing via keyboard characters or mouse click.One downside to Rosetta Stone's approach is that grammar and spelling are a bit tougher to get.  There may be no substitute to old school drills and repetition here.The only thing preventing a five star review is that Rosetta Stone actually puts its security cards--needed to unlock higher lessons---in the flap of the software box.

    "reviewText": "Rosetta Stone makes a nicely polished language learning program, with one fairly substantial drawback:  you won't really learn a language.Rosetta's claim is that by learning a language as a child learns (i.e., without translating into another language), you'll internalize the language and eventually be able to think in it, instead of translating on the fly.  This may be true, but it takes children years and years to learn their first language (they're still studying grammar all the way through 8th grade!).  By adopting a child's approach to language learning, Rosetta will leave you lacking in a lot of key areas that other language learning approaches can quickly teach you.If you took any language courses in school, you may remember how much time you spent conjugating irregular verbs and declining nouns.  These tasks may seem like a useless chore, since you can spend months studying and still feel no closer to fluency.  Nevertheless, a good grasp of grammar lays an excellent foundation for language proficiency later.  Children don't learn this way, since there is no simple clip art that can be presented to them to explain the concept of the future plu-perfect conjugation, or the subjunctive mood.  As an adult with (hopefully) a strong grasp on your language of birth, these advanced concepts can be explained to you early on in your study of a second language, so you don't have to spend years and years down the road trying to build a foundation of grammar and syntax underneath a ramshackle house of vocabulary.Rosetta's approach of teaching some elementary vocabulary (boy, girl, runs, walks) and simple relationship words (over, under, next to, etc.) can quickly give you the power to communicate simple concepts in a new language -- which undeniably can be more useful early on than the ability to conjugate the verb \"to be\" in every person, number, mood and tense.  Their choice of vocabulary words for early emphasis won't be particularly helpful to travelers (other language learning systems may teach you more useful traveling vocab, like \"where is the museum\" and \"what time does the train depart\"), but they will give you the ability to communicate simply.Nevertheless, the lack of emphasis on grammar and syntax (again, because there is no translation into English, only pictures of things and actions, with deductive reasoning to pick up the slack), you may find yourself sounding to a native speaker a bit like Tarzan \"us will gone statue and picture place\" instead of \"would you like to go with me to the museum?\"For the skills that Rosetta stone is trying to teach, the approach is appropriate, and the implementation is very nicely polished (although some of the flashcard-pictures have a weird, taken-in-the-1970s vibe to them).  The approach itself is not enough to teach you a language, and completely ignores the advantages that an adult with a good grasp on their first language can bring to learning a second language.  I think that Rosetta, in combination with a more traditional approach to second-language learning, could be a very powerful combination to help you rapidly internalize vocabulary (with Rosetta), and to lay a good foundation of grammar and syntax.",

Instead, I found lots of fun and enjoyment in the name of learning.Prior to beginning this program, I never understood how total immersion could be conducive to learning a language. To me total immersion meant total confusion.  While this program is guided immersion, it is not confusing.  Vivid pictures and multiple choice games are entertaining.  It is amusing that the pictures are not just of those who appear European but from a variety of cultures. When learning an Italian word, the picture may be of someone of Asian descent.For each level, there are ways to check yourself and review any content you feel needs review. Using a headset (included), you must pronounce words correctly or you will be given an opportunity to repeat it.  The program even breaks down the word into syllables and a visual (chart) to assist in forming the words correctly.The program is easy to install and allows two people to use it. It remembers where each person left off.A friend or mine loves languages, speaks several and teaches English as a foreign language. She found the program to be excellent in its methods.  In fact, she buys Rosetta Stone to review languages she learned in college to keep it fresh.If I can learn while having fun, anyone can.  Love it! Go for it!",

    "reviewText": "I've had the opportunity to review several Rosetta Stone language software programs and have found them all to be quite good.  They all seem to follow the same basic structure which I find to be very helpful in acquiring language skills, and in this case, the basics of Italian language.  I've always wanted to know more about the Italian language but am not motivated to try and become fluent.  Level One for me, is just right.  However, if you are wanting to learn Italian in depth please don't just purchase Level One since it only takes you through some basic elementary language skills.No English is spoken, only Italian and I'm given a lot of visual selections from which to choose the action that represents what I'm hearing in Italian.  I seem to do fairly well having both audio AND a visual component to learning a new language.  Also, I like being able to speak my new Italian words into the included microphone and have the program correct my speech mistakes.  I haven't tried the 3 month on-line service where you can speak with a native speaker (tutor), maybe I would if I were trying to learn the language on a deeper level, but for me I'm happy with just the program itself.  After the 3 months are over you have to pay a fee and I don't like paying fees.I feel fairly confident that anyone who applies themselves regularly to any Rosetta Stone language program will learn a lot of the language being studied.  I find it to be a very natural way to learn a language.  Of course it would be best to be totally immersed in the Italian culture to learn it, but for those of us who don't have that option I think Rosetta Stone does a good job as a cultural immersion substitute.",

    "reviewText": "I wanted a refresher course in Italian so I ordered this Rosetta Stone Italiano - Level 1.  This package is certainly unlike any other language learning program I have run across and even with brief usage, has yielded great results.  Although I have no major complaints with the program itself, the price factor did influence my rating.If you have issues with installing the software, I would check to make sure your pc has the latest version of software installed.  For example, Windows XP requires Service Pack 3 for this language software to work properly and Vista needs SP2.  It is easy enough to download the latest service pack with Windows but I hear mac users have more problems.  If you have an older pc, you really need to check the hardware requirements.  Also note that you must have broadband service to access all the features.The box includes a quick start booklet, installation cds, software cds, headset, user agreement booklet, keyboard stickers to convert for Italian usage and online services.  The quick start guide is important to read first and provides support online or by telephone (called about getting it onto my iPhone and received US based help without going through a phone maze).  The software installed easily on Windows 7 as did the included headset via usb port.  The global end user license agreement booklet was printed in microscopic print so I have my fingers crossed it is the usual stuff since I could not find a magnifying glass to read it. The stickers to place over the keyboard to convert it for Italian usage might prove problematic.  I had an extra keyboard that I placed the stickers on and could switch to when using this software.  I don't know if you would want this on your keyboard all the time and peeling it on and off does not seem ideal.  I think you could get away without using the stickers.This software helps with pronunciation (the headset has a microphone), builds vocabulary and phrases, and teaches simple conversation.  The software has 4 lessons in each unit covering: basics (unit 1), greetings and introduction (unit 2), work and school (unit 3) and shopping (unit 4).  Rosetta Stone advertises a learning application for your iPhone or iPod Touch but an account with Rosetta Stone's online services is required. Although the box states it includes free online features, they are free for three months only.  There is a $25 monthly fee  or a $149 fee for 15 months for online services after the trial period.  The 3 month trial starts the moment you activate your online account and you must be at least 13 to create an account.  I strongly suggest you use the software only and then use the online services to get the most out of this software.  The online services are great and allow you to access online tutors, games, and an online community to practice your Italian.  I really liked the options provided online but wished I had activated the free trial after I had gone through the lessons to get more out of it.  It's hard to converse or play simple games when you are just starting to learn Italian.Overall, this is a great tool to learn Italian if you can afford the hefty price tag.  For the same price you might be able to audit an Italian course at a local school but this software is more convenient and provides more personalized service.  Using this language software in tandem with its online services is almost as good as a private tutor at a lower cost.  I don't think I will continue with the online services given this is just a hobby for me but if you urgently needed to learn Italian, this would be worth the price.  I consider having friendly customer service available by phone a big plus.",

However, this way of learning surpasses everything that I have attempted to do before.  Sure, Rosetta Stone is known for its quality, but this goes further with a new (to me, at least) online feature that allows you to schedule a 50 min. group session with a native speaker.  This provides good practice with a competent conversationalist, taking immersion to another level. Another helpful addition is a series of games that you unlock as you progress through the program.  These games enhance memorization skills.I am glad we made the decision to order this version of Rosetta Stone.",

    "reviewText": "I've used other Rosetta Stone language sets before, and I have become an enthusiastic advocate of the series ever since I first popped the discs into my computer.  This series does a very thorough, professional, and entertaining job of introducing concepts, pronunciation, and culture to the user which makes it fun and intuitive to learn.  One aspect that all users of of this series should think of is the considerable amount of money you will save by taking the Rosetta Stone courses over university-taught courses.  I fully endorse the university experience to everyone, but one part of my education that I didn't appreciate was the way my foreign languages were crow-barred into a tight window dictated by the school's curriculum.  I know that time is a factor in all classroom environments, but in my experience, foreign languages are best taught with more time and patience given to the student.  This set really promotes that idea, and manages to have a great deal of social interactivity as well.This program comes with games, live practice sessions, and practical exercises that were actually kind of fun to participate in. I am surprised at the level of immersion a strictly online application is able to achieve. Before I used this product, I felt a set like this would lack social interaction with other native speakers, and learning pronunciations, backgrounds, and some sort of framework as to why a word is pronounced the way it is. A frustrating aspect of any language course at a university is that you are sped (or slowed) along at whatever pace is dictated to your instructor, thus losing some continuity and flow of the learning process. When one is forced to learn a language in a certain time frame it can either cause a lot of stress for those who don't understand concepts, or bore those who feel like they have a good grasp of the material. This set is very useful because you can learn at your own pace, challenge yourself if you feel up to the task, and never get caught in an annoying time schedule. Taking public language courses can be corrupted by rules and regulations, and this set counteracts that notion. Of course, universities have their own versions of online tests and practices, but none are as colorful and vivid as the ones I've experienced in this set. Rosetta Stone has an online community of users that I checked in on several times, and it was filled each time with people waiting to practice and speak with others. The volume of interaction was huge compared to my university experience which is essential in learning a new language.A great deal of production and attention to detail was put into this Rosetta Stone set, and the level of immersion and exercises is not only high, but very enjoyable and interesting. It might be harder to understand how useful this is without ever having taken a university-taught course in language, but I'm now sold. Frankly, I was a little skeptical of how this would work, because learning a new language ultimately needs to be a social experience, and hearing and witnessing native speakers in action is essential in becoming a skilled speaker. However, this set does a fantastic job of capturing that social interaction, and even manages to be a little more exciting in interacting with others via the internet and phone.This is the second foreign language set I've used, and I'm having a good time learning Italian, at my own pace.  It's important that users make a push to learn and to not take too much time in immersing themselves in the concepts with a foreign language, but it's a huge plus to be able to allow oneself to fully grasp an idea before they move on.  Rosetta Stone allows that window to be more flexible, and ultimately clears the way for better and more effective learning.",

    "reviewText": "I got Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 a few months prior to a vacation in Rome, mainly because the last time my wife and I visited Italy, we went without knowing any Italian and all... and that made for some frustration.I speak Japanese and some Spanish, so I am familiar with the challenges involved in learning a new language. However, Rosetta Stone made it easy and fun to learn very basic Italian. This allowed me to keep the travel book with frequently used phrases in my pocket when asking questions at shops and for directions, mainly.The main problem was once I asked in Italian the person usually would speak to me in Italian and I had to confess, in Italian, that I only knew a very little Italian. So at least they could understand what I was able to say! Thanks to Rosetta Stone I was comfortable not only listening but also speaking Italian because I had so much practice doing both.I'd give yourself at least 2-3 months before trying this in-country, but the pace in which you learn is really up to you. There are so many options that I didn't use... like the online lessons, the games, the community. I just didn't have the time for those and found the basic tutorials quite sufficient (and excellent) but it's great to have those options.",

    "reviewText": "This is my first experience using a Rosetta Stone product. For those who, like me, have never tried it before, here is a brief summary. The software immediately places you into an immersion (sights and sound) environment of still photography and phrases pertaining to the photos. You'll be asked to repeat phrases into the headset, and pronunciation counts (however, it's a great relief to those of us who can't roll our Rs that they allow for that!). You'll also need to type, and click on photos that match what is being said. This specific level attempts to teach basic Italian: colors, greetings and farewells, words that would come up in work and school environments, shopping basics, words for articles of clothing, animals, and the like.My background in learning foreign language is the old-style method of memorization. I would create flashcards of individual words. Repetitive writing by hand was one of the most helpful methods I used to learn--something that's not replicated with Rosetta Stone (though some typing is required). Rosetta Stone, in contrast to the old way of teaching, attempts to teach through immersion. Rather than memorization of one word, a word appears in context in a sentence (or shorter grouping of words), and English translations aren't shown. Rosetta Stone doesn't outright teach in English why a verb is conjugated the way it is, how to (or why you must) match an adjective to a noun, or have you learn specifically how to pronounce vowels and consonants. Instead, the software plunges you into learning by exposure to an all-Italian environment.However, this is exactly why Rosetta Stone may not work for a learner like me. Even though it's fun, it's nevertheless frustrating. I want to know how the words relate to my native language. While using the product, I can't help trying to translate everything into English and trying to understand why the grammar is the way it is. And because it's software, I can't go at my own pace. In high school and college, I would read forward to the next unit if I got ahead of my peers, and remove flashcards of words that needed concentrating on.Not knowing the rules of grammar can be frustrating to someone who learns the way I do. The software seems to be geared more toward those who learn visually. For anyone who has not already tried to learn a foreign language, or has found the old-style memorization method doesn't work for them, I would recommend trying Rosetta Stone. For those like me who have done very well with the old method, you may find it difficult to adapt to an immersion environment.",

One thing though that I'm noticing is that there could be more tailering to the specific language across the product line as to content. There is also a lot of online content with Version 4 now that I'm really not into and comes with a free trial initially. I'd rather have more in the basic product itself but I think most people would like the online interactive material.I am still a fan of the teaching method but the DRM has just become even more bothersome and clunky than before. I didn't have any trouble with the initial install, the trouble is with reinstalling.If you're the kind of person that never has a problem with the computer that requires a reinstall, never reformats a hard drive for maintenance or other problems, then the copyright protections might not be an issue for you. However, I find them bothersome even when following the deactivation instruction and it has required several layers of contact with customer service each time-- even in pocession of deactivation code screen shots. Issues -were- eventually resolved.Hey, it's still pretty good software but I would want to know about convoluted DRM process before plunking down the hefty ticket price. So there.",

You are given images of someone (or several someones) doing various things from cooking, running, swimming, eating, drinking, etc. After like the 100th time of seeing the same 4 images essentially repeat themselves in some manner I think I get it. Having said that I get it, I find it of no practical use in learning or using the language. Maybe for some people learning how to say \"the little girls (boys, men, women) are running, eating, cooking, walking, sleeping, drinking\", etc before learning to say Hey my name is *** followed by whatever, than maybe this is for you, but for my money I think Pimsleur is head and shoulders above this software. I give it a 3 star instead of 1 because it is sort of fun to play with and it helps your ego when you score the inevitable 100% correct at the end of each drill. Cheers",

The 2 components are a grammar/structure aspect & also a dictionary. My inquiry was met with a brash \"No, it does not & Rosetta Stone will never incorporate those features.\"Firstly, let me assure you I'm well-aware of the superiority of the immersion technique, as the primary means of teaching, & am therefore not stating Rosetta Stone should deviate from this methodology of teaching language(s). All I AM stating is that these 2 components would complement & facilitate the process!The representative kept parroting the same, \"Our language system is #1 in the world & by & large everyone loves & bla bla bla...\" He went on to state that \"If you complete all 5 Levels, then you have mastered the language & that there'd be NO need for a dictionary.\" Yes, you read that correctly!!! So I asked the guy, \"Is every word in any given language's dictionary contained within the 5 Levels of the course?\" He said, \"No, but it wouldn't need to be.\" What an ignorantly-indoctrinated imbecilic answer!!!So I improvised a real-world example, whereby a dictionary would be useful. I asked, \"What if, upon mastering all 5 Levels, I saw something interesting on the news about Italy & wanted to call my aunt in Italy & say, 'Aunt Mary, I just saw a segment on the local news about Naples.\" Okay, now what if the word SEGMENT was not contained within those 5 Levels or even if it was, but I'd forgotten how to say it? A Dictionary would OBVIOUSLY be needed!!! His response was, \"You could go online & talk to one of our Language Tutors.\" Of course I replied, \"What if I just want to get the bloody word?!?\" Again, he reiterated \"Rosetta Stone will never incorporate those features in its program.\"His final words were, \"I don't understand where you're going with this. Would you like to purchase 1 or more levels of the Italian program?\" My final words (while laughing) were, \"No, because it doesn't have a dictionary & you're too blind &/or stubborn to admit it's lacking one.\"",

    "reviewText": "ROSETTA STONE is famous for teaching language the way little children learn language...naturally, quickly, without studying verb declention charts, memorizing vocabulary lists, or navagating grammatical oddities. However, there is an obvious problem with this philosophy that ROSETTA STONE has based their teaching method upon. The people who buy and learn from ROSETTA STONE are NOT 3-5 year old children. Any Linguist will tell you, children are hard wired to learn grammer, and to speak perfectly their native language. As we age, the ability to speak certain sounds disappears, and the ability to learn certain types of grammer also disappears. Once a child is past that stage of absorbing grammerical rules naturally, or pronouncing certain native sounds, the door shuts. You can still learn, but not perfectly. This is why a russian who learns english, will NEVER understand exactly how to use definative articles. Also, this is why Russian constanant clusters are impossible to pronounce for English speakers. There are almost NO exceptions to this, except for language savants i suppose.However, as far as learning language in a natural way, on your own, ROSETTA STONE is the best you can do. As anyone knows who's studied foreign languages in high school or college, you start with learning to pronounce the alphabet. Then, you learn the most common words, along with the way basic verbs (TO BE, TO HAVE, TO KNOW, etc) are conjugated, how the nouns and adjectives interact, etc. ROSETTA STONE turns that learning process on its head, and the center of its do-it-yourself language class, is the SPEACH RECOGNITION system. The RS Kit comes with alphabet letters for your computer keyboard (in case your target language has a different alphabet, than the English alphabet), and the computer files, plus four CDs to pracitice pronounciation when away from the computer. Also, the buyer recieves in the box, this headset w/microphone that plugs into the USB port of your computer.(plus a few simple instructions to get started.) Unlike the oldest voice recognition programs from a decade ago, this headset just sets the volumn level, and you are ready to go. Instead of learning to pronounce the alphabet, you just learn to speak the first words a baby might speak...\"cat, run, read, boy, girl, hello, 1,2,3,4,5,6\", stuff like that. Rosetta Stone assumes you will learn the pronounciation rules automatically, \"BY EAR\". First, not everybody CAN learn strickly by ear. Some musicians can hear a song, and they KNOW every chord they heard, and the notes, and can reproduce them instantly, because they can PLAY MUSIC BY EAR. Other musicians need to learn what notes belong where on the instrument, and they need sheet music, and chord theory. WHY? Because some people are more right brain, others more left brain...maybe some people HEAR better, and others analyse better. So, if you are trying to pronounce the Italian word \"ZIA\" (Aunt), you will never GUESS it should sound like TSEE-ah. When English speakers see a \"Z\", they will not pronouce \"TS\", as in German, Russian, Italian, etc. SINCE ROSETTA STONE DOESNT TELL YOU WHAT THE ITALIAN \"Z\" OUGHT TO SOUND LIKE, you need to guess. THis is when the ROSETTA STONE voice recognition just doesnt work. You might hear TSEE-a, but if you see \"ZIA\", your brain will think it's hearing what it's used to hearing--\"ZEE-ah\", and that's what you will say. AND, the voice recognistion WONT recognise the correct pronounciation. Likewise, Italian has other sounds not at all like English, and unless you have some kind of heads up on how each letter SHOULD sound, you may never get close to the correct sound. I have a good ear. But i couldn't hear that Italian has a more dental sounding \"D\" than english. I didnt know the other oddities associated with pronouncing the Italian language. At times, I would click on LANGUAGE LAB, where you get directed to a page that SLOWS DOWN the pronounciation of the word, as well as showing you the voice print, and how the native speaker's voice rises and falls naturally, during the pronounciation of the word. (Apparently for correct stress.) If you are 50% or less away from getting it right, you see a brown cirle that tells you about how close you are, to correct pronounciation. (Plus the system records your attempt at pronouncing the word, so you can compair what you are saying, to that of a native speaker.) If your circle turns green, you are 80% or closer to perfect pronounciation. HOWEVER, this system DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. Once, i tried to pronounce ARRIVIDERCI for 15 minutes. I was UPSET, then angry, then bored, and finally, dejected. Frustration kills motivation, and I think that's why problems with the voice recognition bothers so many people. IF i knew what was wrong with my pronounciation, at least i could TRY to figure out how to say it. I think this happens to EVERYBODY who uses Rosetta Stone at some point. The computer program doesnt say \"The Italian 'G' is PRONOUNCED HARDER THAN ENGLISH 'G'.\" Instead, you are suppose to just KNOW this.  Sometimes, i just believe the voice recognition is just not able to read normal variations in pronounciation correctly. For example, ROSETTA STONE wants you to roll your R's. But, very few people even in Italy can actually make that sound. So then the voice recognistion hears the lack of rolling R's as a mistake in pronounciation. The computer program considers these mistakes as WRONG on your part, and at times the mistakes start to stack up. IF you dont get thru a lesson with a good score, you'll need to repeat the lesson, and also repeat the offending word. (the program tracks a LOT of parameters, including how long its been since you have taken a lesson. Too long, and RS makes you review things before you can start the lessons again. But that's good.) All I can say, is when I could not pronounce a certain word, i almost never knew why. Even tho ROSETTA STONE gives you 4 CDs for pronounciation practice, if you've an inability to say a certain word, you might not ever speak it correctly.My other problem, was that there is NOTHING in the kit, that explains GRAMMER the way you learnt grammer in school. Sometimes, those photos that go with the spoken or written exercise, dont get the idea across very well. THE ONLY SOLLUTION, is to buy some kind of cheap TEACH YOURSELF ITALIAN paperback book, that covers basics of grammer, pronounciation, vocabulary, and all the other holes in the learning of the language, that ROSETTA STONES leaves untouced. AMAZON.COM sells a pretty good book, very cheap, that would help anyone using their ROSETTA STONE class immensely. \"ITALIAN MADE SIMPLE\" by Cristina Mazzoni, for around $8 new. I bought that book, and only then, were the grammer lessons beginning to make sense. ALSO, this book spends time in the beginning, to teach the differences between the way OUR alphabet is pronounced, and the way the Italian Alphabet is pronounced. You NEED to get a book like this, so you understand italian grammer, and have a little bit of an Italian dictionary as well.There are a few other problems with ROSETTA STONE. Everybody says \"DONT SIGN UP FOR LANGUAGE LAB, UNTIL YOU GET THRU THE LANGUAGE BASICS\". Because, depending on how fast, or slow, you are motivated to move thru the lessons, those 3 months of FREE LANGUAGE LAB go by really fast. WAIT TO SIGN UP! ALSO, its good to know that you cant just sign up for language lab a day or two before you want to use it. THERE IS A TWO WEEK WAIT, to have a lesson. Besides the speach recognition problem, and the lack of a good text book so you can learn grammer, pronounciation and vocabulary the way adults learn language, everything about ROSETTA STONE's classes are LOTS OF FUN. Really. They have games that help you keep those new words constantly in your mind. There are stories that help with reading, that are clued into your number of finished lessons. ITALIAN LEVEL ONE, for example, is divided into UNIT ONE, language basics, UNIT TWO, Greetings, UNIT THREE, Work and school, UNIT FOUR, shopping. By the time you finish that much of the course, you should be able to get around Italy, and make basic conversation. I would guess your proficiency level might be FIRST YEAR COLLEGE ITALIAN, or two years of high school italian, or 1-2 Italian grandparents. ROSETTA STONE is very visually interesting, and will keep you motivated once you get past that first unit (language basics), so long as you dont have major problems being understood by the voice recognition software. I wish i had waited for the langauge lab, because i'm SURE that would have helped. However, if you don't use it as much as you want after the first 3 months, its only $25 a month, for more time with those online tutors. All things considered, VOICE RECOGNITION really DOES work remarkably well. I'm sure most of the problems people have, come from their inablity to pronouce certain sounds specific to their target language, rather than the program's inability to understand your voice. If you are speaking the language correctly, I would guess anywhere from 96-99% of the time, ROSETTA STONE understands EXACTLY what you say. If some word (like my problem with ARRIVIDERCI) comes up, you can easily skip the word. There is NO OTHER SELF TAUGHT LANGUAGE CLASS that can perfect your speach, increase your vocabulary, and engage you in an \"immersion\" type language adventure, like ROSETTA STONE can.  NO OTHER SYSTEM has the native speaker 1 on 1 language lab. The only REAL problem is if you learn on your own, its hard to keep your motivation for learning high. You'll need discipline and some kind of reward, ie, a trip to Italy if you finish LEVEL 1? (Or maybe just a FELLINI film. Whatever rocks your boat.) Good luck with your language adventure, and ARRIVIDERCI!",

    "reviewText": "I got this program for Christmas this year 2011. Its been about 2 days of using the program and i have to say i have learned more in those 2 days than i have in 5 years with other methods. I previously already knew some Japanese before starting this program but it was very broken and limited Japanese. I truly feel that if i keep at it with lessons i will be able to master this language within 4 years. That's about the time i have heard other people who have mastered the language say it took them in classes. I love the program and will be getting Italian next. Although, i already know broken and limited Italian as well. The Italian will be easier for me to learn i suspect. Its just a easier language to learn compared to Japanese. With how much Japanese i learned with the program in just 2 days of lessons, i suspect that i will master Italian in about 2 years. It's a good program and i am very happy with it. This method may not be for everyone. I am more of a visual learner and have photographic memory so maybe that is why i was able to pick up so much in just 2 days. To Visual learner's YES i do recommend this program.I do each lesson 5 times a day. I am already on core lesson 2. My ending score for core lesson 1 is about 98% in 2 days. What is in that lesson, i honestly did not know before i started the program. So before you buy this program you need to decide if your an audio or visual learner first. I do honestly feel that i will be able to learn at least half of any language that i plan to learn with Rosetta Stone. Thank you Rosetta Stone for making it easier and most importantly more FUN!This program does require you to think and remember. It won't do the memorizing and thinking for you. The writing part is difficult though and i think its more of a program to teach you to understand Japanese when spoken to you. The only thing i don't like about it, is it doesn't give you many options to record you, repeating the things its teaching you to make sure your pronouncing it all correctly.",

No one really learns that way.  If we did, damn near everyone in the US would be bilingual because of HS language. After 4 years of Spanish or French who really leaves school knowing how to speak a 2nd language?  Plus, I'm watching my 3 year old niece pick up Spanish like she's drinking water.

The Japanese tool provides some basics but has much room for improvement. The same difficulties exist with both.(1) The milestones frustrate learners greatly. Only a SINGULAR programmed response is acceptable; there is far too little information to discern it exactly (or even guess something close sometime); and as unacceptable responses mount negativity towards the product grows. This terrible feature (Milestone) should be eliminated or vastly improved.(2) The allowable pronunciation of some runes (boht Japanese and SPanish) is VERY tight, while it is quite loose on others. It is irritating & frustrating. The pronunciation aid screen provides additional insight, but there are a few letters I cannot produce acceptably. In Japanese Shi, Chi, and Sa are far too tight. The use should be able to LOOSEN these.(2a) Even after I produce an acceptable pronunciation, later in the lesson it is rejected. A HUMAN is needed to explain and help. The COMPUTER only defeats the learner's enthusiasm.(2b) In longer words and sentences, the same mispronunciation of the same runes is allowed. The program is inconsistent.(2c) What are you trying to teach? Can a native speaker understand the learner? If so, let it pass - even for single runes.(3) The estimated time for each lesson is FAR too low. To think, read the strange new Japanese runes, pronounce the words (acceptably), and try to impress them into memory requires effort.(4) When new words are introduced through a group of pictures, the learner islimited to SIGHT only. FOUR of the FIVE other senses are NOT ENGAGED. This is NOT AS ADVERTISED \"learning the way you learned your first language.\"(5) Because of this, a collection of pictures (for example family members) should NOT be used to INTRODUCE new words. The method of sound plus 2 pictures then choice of 3 pictures, followed by one picture with audio and a choice of three, followed by audio and the same choice of three is FAR BETTER. At least it involves TWO SENSES.(6) A collection of 4 or more pictures should be programmed to keep the \"NOT\" choice until later among the choices. When the FIRST choice is \"The person is not a DOCTOR\" and there are 4 pictures, one of which is a doctor, it is difficult to pick out the correct picture. You may think you've given enough clues, but it is NOT a positive experience for the learner who is unsure what the word for doctor is.(7) I tried to return to UNIT 1 after the MILESTONE and the program does not allow it. You need a REVIEW OPTION.(7a) On my demand, I want to see pictures of NOUNS, their spelling, and AUDIO. When I learned my original language, I could do that via human interaction or media.(7b) On demand I want to see verbs also.(7c) I want to be able to get a definition, even if its only in Japanese using words I've already supposedly learned, on demand. For example, FUTARI. Eventually I had to ask a native speaker what it meant. At first I thought it meant standing, then smiling, then I gave up.",

Too bad both programs are ridiculously expensive, I don't think either program is worth the price. Rosetta stone is worthless and I would only consider paying for a used copy of Pimsleur because a new one costs ten times what I would pay to learn the language. The price for both is about the same. A great program that is worth the price is Human Japanese, it is more structured than the other two and gives you a better grasp of the grammar than either of the others as well. Personally I use both Pimsleur and Human Japanese, Rosetta Stone is overpriced garbage.",

    "reviewText": "Rosetta Stone's Japanese software can only really be used in conjunction with other Japanese learning resources. In my experience, it is good for practice if you already know the material being covered. Learning from it as a sole resource is unreasonable. They simply don't spend enough time drilling vocabulary and there is pretty much no grammar being taught.Problem with Rosetta Stone is that they don't explicitly tell you anything in your native language.  Instead, they expect you to infer meanings and make your own connections. The problem with this is that the user will probably end up making the incorrect associations without a parent or teacher to correct them.  Many of the pictures (from which you are expected to derive fairly complex concepts at times) are overly ambiguous.  However, if you already know the language, the pictures can make sense... most of the time.If you are already studying Japanese and you simply need something to help you with listening comprehension, then that is pretty much all this is good for... and really, it isn't great for that.  For the price, you are much better off looking elsewhere.  The websites iKnow.jp, TextFugu.com, and Skritter.com come to mind.  You'll end up getting set back about the same amount of $$ as buying just Level 1 of Rosetta Stone Japanese, but the amount of content you receive is far greater and of a much higher quality.  If you are not interested in online study materials, the Pimsleur Japanese audio series is far superior to Rosetta Stone and also available right here on Amazon.com",

    "reviewText": "I just finished level 1 of Japanese, and from the time I started to now I've learned tons of Japanese. I can't say all of this was from Rosetta Stone, though. I thought Rosetta Stone was pretty good, but I don't think I could call it a standalone resource to learn Japanese. A major part of learning Japanese is mastering the katakana, hiragana, and kanji, and Rosetta Stone is definitely not the best way to do that. There's a section of the program that teaches katakana and hiragana, but I feel that Rosetta Stone has a pretty inefficient way of teaching the alphabet.I really liked Rosetta Stone's voice recognition. Not many other programs offer that. I had to turn up the speech precision difficulty though because I thought it was being too lenient on pronunciation. I definitely did not like the milestones at the end of each unit, which expect the user to speak his/her way through a \"real life\" situation. The problem is that even though language is dynamic and diverse, Rosetta Stone says there's a single specific response for everything, and it's not easy at all to guess this from the context.Rosetta Stone was great for teaching vocabulary, and I've retained most of what I've learned from it. To fill the shortcomings of Rosetta Stone, I've been using some other resources which I'll list here.Human Japanese: For the money, this teaches much more than Rosetta Stone can. It covers the alphabet, grammar, vocabulary, and cultural notes and it's a really interesting read.GENKI I: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese [With CDROM] (Japanese Edition) (English and Japanese Edition): I'm only a few chapters into Genki, but it's known as one of the best \"real\" textbooks for self study.Remembering the Kana: A Guide to Reading and Writing the Japanese Syllabaries in 3 Hours Each (part 1) (Japanese Edition): Dr. Heisig's Remembering the Kana was the quickest, most efficient way I could find to learn the kana.Remembering the Kanji: A Complete Course on How Not to Forget the Meaning and Writing of Japanese Characters: Heisig's Remembering the Kanji has taught me several hundred kanji so far, and I still remember the ones I learned almost a year ago.I liked Rosetta Stone a lot, but it's too expensive for what it gives. For the same price as a single Rosetta Stone level, you could buy a much more diverse set of resources and learn a lot more. If money isn't an issue though, go for it. I think 3.5 or 4 stars is a good rating.",

    "reviewText": "I started off loving Rosetta Stone.  I still have a pretty good retention of the words in the first 8-10 chapters even several years later.  For this I'm giving it 3 stars.My frustration with the product began as images and their meaning started to become more complex.  For example, when you are trying to indicate that an item is in front of another item you really need to know what the perspective is.  Is it from my perspective or from the item's perspective?  Without a teacher, native speaker or some kind of reference material, this is only possible through a leap of intuition.  As my frustration with this type of problem rose, I eventually gave up on the program.It was only later that I found out that Rosetta Stone was actually teaching me the wrong words as well.  I happened to be at EPCOT in the Japan pavillion looking at some of their language books and I read that 'to read' is 'YOMU'.  Rosetta had taught me that \"to read a  book\" is \"hon o yonde imas\".  I asked the girl behind the counter about the apparent contradiction and she confirmed that 'yomu' is the proper verb.  I later learned that 'yonde' means 'to call'.  So I was learning \"to call a book\"?!  Needless to say, I was very disappointed not just in learning the wrong word but in now not knowing if I learned others wrong too.The final straw was when I went to Rosetta Stone and found that there was no option to upgrade without re-purchasing the software.  For the price of this software, a user should be paying to learn the language, not just buying a couple of CDs.  At the least I expected a trade-in program at just the price of shipping.  So, overall, not a positive experience.On a side note, I did the free version of Human Japanese for smart phone and quite enjoyed it.  Can't speak for the full version but I'm strongly tempted.",

There is almost no grammar or verb conjugation instruction which yes is boring but is necessary to learn a language and No, I don't believe this can be picked up by \"immersion.\"Have you ever take a language class where the teacher showed you pictures of people driving and you thought, \"Ah, that is a negative verb conjugation.\" No, yet this is how Rosetta expects you to learn-- without any instruction. I'm trying to learn a new language not play pictionary.Because I was annoyed with the lack of instruction, I bought the Genki textbooks and found a tutor (native speaker) who has taught me more in 4 hours then the 4 weeks I spent clicking on pictures. I'm still using the program because it is good vocabulary practice but my tutor rolled her eyes and laughed when I told her I was using Rosetta Stone to learn Japanese.",

    "reviewText": "I study foreign languages in my free time. Having said that, my preferences lean towards product that aid in increasing my confidence in speaking, reading, writing, and understanding. Generally, these programs have clear audio, pictures, simple grammar lessons, and clear breakdowns of phonetic structures for non-native speakers (being entertaining and cheap is always a plus!)Rosetta Stone is a wonderful vocabulary builder. The pictures and audio help store new words in long-term memory. The games *can* be fun and the lessons test listening skills and adaptive recall. With purchase, a user gains access to online tutoring sessions with a native speaker after completing chapter units (to try out their new skills.) Listening to the natural rhythm of native speakers in the program helps reduce accent and familiarize a user with the new language. There is a lot of content in level 1 of Japanese alone, which is broken into 4 units: Language Basics, Greeting/Introductions, Work/School, and Shopping. Each lesson builds on the last, helping the user retain vocabulary previously studied (but sadly, nearly prohibiting skipping ahead).Unfortunately, there are some major flaws:This isn't the fastest self-taught curriculum; you won't learn useful, everyday phrases right away. Sure, I understand \"The cat is sleeping.\" Or, \"The boy runs.\" That's good, but how am I to realistically apply this to practical conversation? It took hours of lessons to learn phrases like \"goodnight,\" or \"Where is the bathroom?\"Grammar is never fully broken down. Users are left guessing how or why sentence structure or the Japanese particle system works (if they can even figure out what that is). Vocabulary, even with the pictures, is also vague at times. A child learning a new language uses a lot of guess work and is constantly corrected by parents in the early stages of language development. An adult, however, shouldn't need to make nearly as many mistakes as a babbling toddler, let alone without being constantly corrected. When confused about a word or phrase meaning, there is no direct translation available through Rosetta Stone itself- ever. I shouldn't need to use Google Translate to understand what I'm learning. It can be frustrating for absolute beginners. The phrases, when repeated listen for accuracy in the user's speech. However, one must only be about 80% correct for a sentence to register as right. I tested by saying and omitting words at times, and skimmed through the lesson with few problems. It's not that it's not okay to make mistake while learning, but proceed with caution. The words pop up as the user speaks them. Parts of a sentence that do not register as clear will appear in a more faded font. There were times when I spoke correctly, and still read faded font, second-guessing myself. (Though my sensei confirmed I was correct!)Lastly, despite having lots of content, the lessons can be insanely repetitive and even confusing at times. It's easy for beginners to get disheartened, or think that language isn't their niche due to a poor start with the wrong learning materials. Conversational Japanese is actually the easiest self-taught language I've studied, with consistent sentence structures and easily approachable sounds for native English and Spanish speakers.I used Rosetta Stone as a vocabulary builder along with my college JPN 103 class. I got what I paid for: increased confidence, greater fluency, and larger vocabulary. The catch is that I already mostly understood what and why words were ordered in each set. I recommend Rosetta Stone for people with some basic knowledge of Japanese language looking to build on what they already know, but definitely not for a novice. For the money, I can see how this would be an overwhelming frustrating disappointment. Invest in something with audio and a simple grammar book, some hiragana/katakana workbooks, and flashcards.

    "reviewText": "First of all, I haven't used this product yet (so why am I writing this?). What I'm reviewing is how the company is advertising their product, because to be perfectly honest it's turning me away from it more than drawing me to it. Rosetta Stone keeps boasting that it will \"teach you the language the way you learned your first language as a child.\"That is complete bullcrap. And it is backed by both Linguistic research and Speech Pathology research. Let me break down what we currently believe happens in language learning, both with first language acquisition and the second.Our native language is learned while we're children. No one knows how or why, but babies and young kids are hardwired to pick up and tease apart sounds and grammatical structures in ways that adults CAN'T. This is because different parts of their brains are being used in this process. Babies aren't only learning by people showing them pictures, they're learning through context, human touch and intonation when spoken to, and simple observation of day to day life. THAT is immersion, and kids are fantastic at it. Kids are also better at learning second languages because they still retain the capacity to sort things out simply through those techniques.Adults can't. Some have an easier time than others. Immersion is still by far the best method because we're forced to try and make sense of what's going on. However, it's the hardest road for a beginner, and quite frankly, no computer program can ever teach by immersion because it doesn't have the qualities stated above as of yet. Just from what I'm reading and seeing, showing a picture and only pictures without translations isn't immersion, and it's definitely not language instruction. My Korean textbook tried this, and for me personally it failed completely. Adults need more guidance until they can get the human kind of immersion. Like what was said before I typed this, we need sounds and videos of examples of the same content.Immersion is learning with all five senses, which is why classrooms and most computer programs fail. Not everyone is a visual learner, just like not everyone can learn through textbooks. You need visual, audio, and even role-playing scenes to get material in your head. And while Rosetta Stone boasts there's no memorization, that's also not good for either children or adults. Guess what? Children memorize, they just do it without thinking about it because they're exposed to the same materials again and again. If you take away the ability to review past lessons and re-do exercises after certain milestones, you're eliminating half of what adults sadly do have to do in order to learn a language.I'm not trying to cast a bad light on Rosetta Stone or anything, I would still like to try the program. I have just graduated university with a degree in Japanese and a minor in Linguistics, and I would like to have a reliable resource to practice with so that I don't lose my skills. But I need repetition, and if this program doesn't allow for that, then I will have to sadly take my money elsewhere.Stop advertising that you're teaching the way we learn as kids, because we don't learn like we did as children, and no computer program as of today's technological capacity can simulate that immersion. It comes off more like a cheap imitation than a program that knows what it's doing.",

As a linguist and ESL teacher, I know the limitations of such programs, compared to taking a course or making friends with a speaker of the other language.The best use of Rosetta Stone is for visual learners to pick up basic vocabulary. Even if there were a RS 2 or 3 for Korean, which there isn't, it still wouldn't help you much beyond that. A picture dictionary provides the same benefit, though. It would have far more words than RS does, for $90 cheaper, and it'd be easier to carry around. Plus you could add related words in the margins! Get one with a CD, so you can mimic the pronunciation.The language quality for Rosetta Stone products is hit or miss. For languages such as Spanish or French, the language is perfect. For Korean or Hindi, though, RS products stink. They're full of language errors! Language learners won't know that they're learning bad Arabic or Korean, until they finally make a friend from that culture. By that time, they don't need RS anymore. You'd think their quality control would be much better.There's also an issue with poor service. Years ago, I misplaced my disk 1. This was years ago. RS wants to charge me an exorbitant amount to replace that disk, even though I still have disk 2, so obviously I'm not trying to scam them. So I deducted a star for poor service.My advice for LL is:1. Get a picture dictionary with a CD.2. Stay motivated! Study regularly! Use what you know! Get lots of rest!3. Take good language courses with real instructors who care about you.4. Find ways to make friends with people who speak that language. You might do a language exchange, and teach each other your mother tongues!Blessings.",

    "reviewText": "I bought this product or an earlier version of it some time ago.  It was sold with a guarantee, but when I wrote to get my money back, I never got an answer.Why did I want my money back?  Well, I was not learning Korean with it despite hundreds of hours with it [I only stuck with it because I had spent so much money and knew of no available alternative at that time].  The pictures were ambiguous and in a few classes unclear [I am not used to seeing a horse's head up so close that I can't recognize it. There is a picture showing a leg and a foot -- which one is meant?  What is being said with the guy falling off in the rodeo or the guy on the skateboard?].  It took me a long time to figure out the prepositions of place without any explanation.The program also doesn't allow for the fact that there are not one-to-one mappings from \"observation\" to a target language for  all prepositions of place [think of the diverse uses of the English preposition of place \"on\"]. In Korean, the words for red and blue have a contrasting initial consonant, that I cannot hear in the program, but the second consonant, though written the same, sounds distinctly different to me.  Maybe these are allophones, maybe not:  But RS is no help here.I worked HARD on this program.  It was one of the most frustrating experiences in my life.  In fact, I got to the point where I knew all the answers but still had no idea what I was saying in 10~20% of them.  The review system seemed faulty:  I would be tested again and again on words and phrases I already knew and got correct -- and not get out of the loop.  This is NOT how I learned my first language.  [Besides that, as an adult, I don't expect, and research does not indicate, that I will learn L1 and L2.]  Here are two places where some guidance would have been helpful:1] Korean has two systems for counting, pure Korean and Sino-Korean.  There are specific applications for each, e.g., for how much something costs versus how things are being bought.  RS teaches one set of numbers, but then times are taught, with-out any explanation that the numbers just learned are simply a different system than what applies to the hours of the day.  2] Korean only uses plural markers and subjects when they are not clear from the context.  But RS seems to be ignorant of this, very early on make a big to-do [as I would if I were teaching English, German or Spanish, for example] of the difference between 'banana' and 'bananas.'  This certainly did not help me when I got to Korea and tried to buy things!The speakers speak rapidly.  This is a natural speed for Seoul natives.  But some allowance should be made for 1] learners and 2] the reality that people in some parts of Korea speak much more slowly.Even  more of the content is questionable: A Korean friend said that the sentences were unrealistic.",

The rules for this can not be intuited from the immersion technique in Rosetta Stone.  Even if you can recognize \"psa\" and \"pies\" as both \"dog\", and even if you can recognize \"dwa\", \"dwie\", \"dwoje\", \"dw&oacute;ch\", etc. as all being the number two (and this alone is a challenge), there is simply no way to be able to predict which of these you are supposed to use and when.  That said, Rosetta Stone Polish IS fun.  Just learn some Polish through other means first, and then come back here after you've gotten past an introductory level elsewhere.If you are looking for a FUN computer program that teaches you Polish and teaches you the grammar rules of Polish along the way, I recommend Polski Bez Problemu +, Levels 1-3, instead.  If you go this route, make sure you get the + version, as the one without is just a textbook and some MP3s.  But it is the software that makes this purchase valuable, as it has interactive exercises that adapt to your mistakes.  Do a web search on Supermemo World EU, because it is made by a company based in Poland and is therefore often out of stock on Amazon.  SeePolski Bez problemu!+ Elementary Level A1-A2 (Book & CD-ROM)for my review of Level 1.If you are an absolute beginner in Polish, I would actually recommend that you first get an audio-only course, such as Pimsleur Polish 1 Comprehensive or Michel Thomas Method--Total and Perfect Polish.  (SeePolish, Comprehensive: Learn to Speak and Understand Polish with Pimsleur Language ProgramsandTotal Polish with the Michel Thomas Method (Michel Thomas Series)), and then later move on to things like Polski Bez Problemu + and/or Rosetta Stone.

Levels 1-3 will give you a good foundation in the language and probably some fairly good speaking skills - but you will still have a ways to go. Also, sadly, you will not have developed very much conversational skills after this first level. You will learn some \"need-to-know\" stuff, yes, but stuff that you will most likely not use very much. There are sentences like \"The cat is in the hat\" and \"The keys are in the shoe\". I understand the reasoning behind forming sentences like this (prepositions and the prepositional case), but you would think that more focus would be paid on actual conversational skills.Another gripe is that the images are not unique to the language. You would think that if you pay over $200 bucks for one level (and over $500 for all three) that you would be getting something unique. Having said that, there is a wide range of different Russian speakers throughout level one - all very pleasant and easy to understand.The online features are absolutely great. This is one reason why it's earned four stars from me. I honestly think Rosetta Stone could really make some money if they separated the software and their online stuff.So, to sum everything up: this is a good, addictive, and interactive product; but it definitely shouldn't be your only resource. Buy some books to understand some of the grammar, and try to get yourself a dictionary or always have Google Translate handy and ready to go. Also, try to hook up with some native speakers via Skype or something, especially if you want to learn some real conversational skills. You can probably learn more in a few hours with a native speaker (when it comes to day-to-day conversations) than Rosetta Stone Russian level 1 will teach you.",

    "reviewText": "I decided to try out learning Russian with Rosetta Stone, and I think that I've made a good choice.The program is easy to use, just like all Rosetta Stone products. I would recommend learning at least the alphabet before starting, as that definitely helps the program make more sense. This actually comes with an alphabet guide, but you should probably use another source to learn it. Also, learning some grammar before starting could be of much use. I remember having absolutely no idea which choice to make on many of the grammar questions early on. This is alright, however, as you'll end up figuring it out mostly by using Rosetta Stone.As I'm an absolute beginner, I did like that Rosetta Stone just starts off with vocabulary. It gives a good feel for the pronunciation of words and other basic concepts. I must admit, though, that it was pretty scary to start the very beginning lesson with a near impossible-to-pronounce word, devushka (\"girl\" in the English alphabet). Aside from that, the program starts off nicely with vocab, and progresses to grammar and some basic conversation. It becomes even more complex once each core lesson (and then unit) is mastered. The \"standard\" course is perfect for learning the language overall, although there are different courses that can specifically focus on speaking, reading, or writing. There are also standard courses with different introductions, extended courses, and placement tests.Some people may not like Rosetta Stone's style of full immersion. I suppose it does make some parts difficult, but it also teaches you better than simple translations.I'd definitely recommend this product. I'm not even done using it yet, but it's taught me a lot of Russian and I will be getting the next levels.",

    "reviewText": "I'm a linguist by training, with a focus in how people learn languages.  The concept behind Rosetta Stone is based on the observation that children can induce the grammar of their mother tongue from examples in which the specific functions of linguistic units are contrasted.  As Rosetta Stone would have it, since children learn effortlessly this way, then why not adults?The problem is that children require millions of impressions to induce the grammar.  Also, when mature humans learn a second language, the syntax of the first language interferes with the notions one constructs of the second.  It's therefore highly inefficient to teach language this way.  With adults it's actually much more efficient to be more explicit about the grammar of the target language -- to provide clear descriptions of the rules accompanied by many examples and much practice.  Immersion can be very useful, but not to the exclusion of explicit instruction in the rules of the language.  I found myself playing a tortured game of 'find waldo', trying to figure out, say, is X the feminine form of some plural article?  One ends up learning a few wooden formulae, but not learning the structure of the language.Aside from this, I found the software implementation to be very weak.  The whole activation mechanism is painful.  If you switch computers or re-install the OS on a machine, you have to go through a tortured process with Rosetta Stone support to obtain a working activation code.  Versions 3 and 4 failed to co-exist on my Win7 x64 system.  When I tried to use V3, an installer was kicked off which quickly failed, after which neither Version 3 nor 4 worked, and I had to reinstall both -- which required the laborious process of obtaining new activation codes (for some reason).  Oh, and forget refunds, if you purchase from Amazon, none are given, even if the software stops working on your machine.The software itself seems to be written using some cross-platform tool that reminds me of Macromedia Director -- hell, it may be just that.  It's laggy, the fonts are ugly, the images are full of artifacts, the UI looks like it was designed by a software intern with no design experience.  The tool to judge pronunciation is horribly insensitive in Version 3 (I speak other Romance languages, so I can tell), and in Version 4 they adjusted to customer complaints by making it far more tolerant, so now it's a joke -- one can score green even with comically distorted renditions of the cues.Here is a complaint letter written by a developer to the CEO of Rosetta: [...]Overall, I suggest steering away from this product.",

I am very well familiar with pronounciation of vowels and dipthongs not normally found in my native tongue.That having been said, I find the Rosetta Stone software's ability to rate my speech as extremely poor.  It often refuses to recognize my voice pronouncing words (and even single syllables).  Moreover, when I repeat a word or phrase into the microphone, it often does not recognize that I have stopped speaking, and the software simply sits there doing nothing. If it were human it would be wearing an idiot's grin.  I am not exaggerating when I say that I repeat a one-syllable word and the program sometimes takes up to 20 seconds to acknowledge it (whether I pronounced the word correctly or not is immaterial). Note that I am using a state-of-the-art PC, so hardware isn't the issue.Furthermore, the Rosetta Stone \"immersion\" approach to language learning is not good for anyone who has learned a second or third language through formal lessons.  The software is designed to NOT take your native tongue into account, but the only benefit of that is to Rosetta Stone, NOT the learner.  Many languages have sets of rules regarding gender agreement or unorthodox pronounciation; most languages have regular rules about conjugation.  RS imparts NONE of these rules; doing so would require an explanation in every native tongue.  Instead, you are left to figure it out on your own. This seriously impedes the process.  What this product will do is teach you to speak BAD Swedish.In short, if this is your first attempt at learning a non-native language, it might work for you.  But if you have any experience in multiple languages, RS will likely leave you feeling frustrated.",

    "reviewText": "Simply put: it doesn't work. Rosetta Stone claims to design their software based on the idea that you can learn a second language the way you learned your first one, through so-called immersion. First of all, using Rosetta Stone hardly qualifies as immersion. Secondly, anyone who has studied second language acquisition knows that adults do not and should not learn language as if they were children. It may sound easy because most of us don't remember much about learning our first language, but if you think about it from a common-sense perspective you will realize that even a ten-year old native speaking child still makes many errors. Do you want to spend ten years trying to learn a second language? Second language acquisition programs should take into account the fact that adults have many more language and cognitive skills that they can employ in their language study than children do. A well-developed program would account for this and use this to the learner's advantage. Rosetta Stone does not do this.From a motivational standpoint it is also a very discouraging program. As others have said, it doesn't teach you how to communicate. Pimsleur's audio programs, while still limited in some ways, have the advantage of teaching you language that allows for immediate conversation (or immediate conversation with people you don't know well.) I found it very encouraging that I was able to use the Turkish I learned in my first lesson to strike up a conversation with a Turkish man I met at an international dinner at my university. All I did was asking him if he was a Turk and respond that no, I am American when he asked me if I was Turkish. (You can imagine how please I was to be asked.) But with Rosetta Stone you won't be able to do this. You'll be able to say hello and then point to the people at another table and make the astute observation that they are eating a meal.It is unfortunate that the program is not more useful because resources for Turkish study are quite limited. But until Rosetta Stone learns to incorporate some conversational skills and sound SLA theory into their programs I would suggest avoiding them unless you have money to burn.",

My fiance is Turkish and I spent HOURS painstakingly using Rosetta Stone, only to be able to say random nouns and sentences like \"The boy is in the plane\" or \"The girl is under the table\". The only way I even grasped that much was thanks to him sitting next to me helping translate words so that I didn't confuse words like 'sitting' and 'listening'.I should note that learning languages comes easily to me. I am a native English speaker, fluent in Spanish, excelled at reading Latin for years, and also was at one point moderately capable in Italian after a year of instruction in college. Rosetta Stone Turkish left me frustrated and incapable of communicating with my future in-laws. Save your money!!!",

    "reviewText": "I'm about halfway through the program and I must say, Rosetta Stone is making the task of learning Vietnamese much more enjoyable and less daunting then I originally expected. However, there are 2 problems that have come to my attention early on which made me want to review this before completing the course. First, since the program is a full emersion program, while I am picking up on words and associations, I often find myself not understanding the entire phrase of what is being said. I wish there was an option to show the statements in English to just confirm what I thought was just shown to me.The other problem, however, I find worse. The microphone that comes with the program is terrible. First off, unless I'm doing something wrong the headset speakers doesn't work. All my sound came out of my computer speakers. Even more frustrating is that the mic rarely picks up what I am saying. I find myself saying phrases and words several times before the program acknowledges it. Then, it often doesn't register exactly what I said. I know Vietnamese is a tonal language, but I say the same thing without changing the pronunciation multiple times before the program says I'm correct. If I was pronouncing it wrong, then it should never say I did it correctly. If you're getting this program and your computer doesn't have a built in mic, I'd recommend buying one outside what comes in the box.In all, the program is great and I'm already starting to feel confident speaking to my girlfriend's family (who are Vietnamese) but I am not completely confident to carry entire conversations. Hopefully as I continue things will change.",

    "reviewText": "Having owned version 2 of Rosetta Stone Vietnamese, I was excited to try Rosetta Stone's new Version 4 TOTALe program.  Since they offered a trial or demo disk, I ordered a disk and tried it.  It seemed good and I liked all the improvements over version 2.  So I decided to buy the the program.  To Rosetta Stone's credit, this version is a giant step forward in interaction and variation of teaching methods to keep the Vietnamese student involved and interested.  The package includes a headphone & microphone set so you can speak the words you hear, and the computer will let you know if you're pronouncing the words and phrases correctly.  In fact, you can set the program's tolerance level of your pronounciation.  This new version also allows you to type in the words and phrases your hear, thereby helping you to learn how to spell the new language you are speaking.Unfortunately, in spite of all these new improvements, there were two problems (serious problems in my evaluation) that made me return the program for a refund.  The first problem was pronounciation.  Vietnamese is a tonal language; in fact, it has 6 different tones.  Also, there is a significant difference between the North Vietnamese dialect and the South Vietnamese dialect.  This program proportedly teaches the northern dialect, but the pronounciation is not correct.  In version 2, the pronounciation was textbook perfect; each tone was distinct and precise.  In version 4, they've gotten sloppy.  Specifically the high-rising tone used in some words (like con cho' [= dog], con ga'i [= girl], etc.) is pronounced  with a falling, rising tone (like pha?i [= yes] or ho?i [= question].  My wife, who is Vietnamese, confirmed these mispronounciations.The other problem is the method used to type in Vietnamese words.  When Vietnamese people type proper Vietnamese with tone marks, they usually use one of two methods: VIQR and VNI. (Look up these methods on the internet.)  But, Rosetta Stone doesn't use either of these common methods; instead have come up with their own method.  Unfortunately, it is very cumbersome and painfully slow.So, because of these 2 serious problems, I can't fully reccommend this program.  There are many other programs available that teach Vietnamese.  One I CAN recommend is called \"A Little Vietnamese\" by Griesser Software.  This program is unique in that it teaches both North and South Vietnamese dialects and the differences between them.  Unfortunately, it does not work on Macintosh computers, unless you have a Windows-simulator program (like Virtual PC or Parallels).  Rosetta Stone V4 will work on both Mac and Windows machines.",

There is very little new material in each new edition that comes out every few years.  Now, in 2002, there are lots of new and betterguidebooks out there. I can recommend Insight Guides, Rough Guides, and DK travel guides, to name only a few good ones.Joe Cummings has been the main author of the Thailand TravelGuide for over two decades. He is also the author of many othertravel guidebooks published by Lonely Planet. The problem with his books is that he is not excited about travel, and this feeling comes through in his guidebooks. He is an expert on Asian art history, and I think that it would be more appropriate if he wrote books specifically about this subject, instead of travel guides for the general public.To get a good feeling about the kind of writer that Joe Cummings is, I would strongly recommend that you also read through the reviews of his Travel Guide to Laos, which is alsopublished by Lonely Planet.",

The information is sometimes wrong (unfortunately at the most inconvenient of times).  In addition the book is hardly a &quot;guide&quot;.  The walking tours, for example, give you little information and simply plop you at a site.  This is more of a handbook to accommpany a map.  The book seems to inspire the kind of tourism where one looks, but does not realy try to understand the culture around you. The worst part about this book is that it is not arranged well.  Each area you visit is arranged by &quot;activity&quot; like accommodation or food.  This is particularly annoying in the Bangkok section, where one has to constantly flip from section to section in order to figure out anything about where you are in the area of town you are visiting.  On the positive side, the recommendations of accomodation are decent.  Overall though, I recommend to get another guide.  Lonely planet has gone lazy.",

It is definitely not an afghan book for the beginning knitter but if you have gotten the essentials of knitting under your belt, this book has beautiful patterns to try.There is a wonderful intarsia section with the possibility of all kinds of adaptations.  These quilts would be especially wonderful for that child (or inner child) in your life.My favorite section is the cable/aran section.  I drool over the afghans here especially Diamond Drapes.  My favorite color afghan is the Mudcloth one.  Having travelled to Africa, this afghan brings back wonderful memories.I am also an avid lace knitter and I think that the Diamond Lace afghan is extraordinarily beautiful and feminine.  I can't wait to knit it.I applaud Ms. Epstein on not using charts except for intarsia for which they are essential.  I hate charts.  I love that her patterns are written out line by line.  For knitters like me, it makes the difference between buying a book or leaving it on the shelf.",

I collect knitting books and there are not many amongst the recent onslaught of books that I find add anything to the science and art of knitting.  Nicky's books do.  All of them in general and this one in particular are fantastic.  She has a style and sense of color that is inspiring.  Note: not all of the designs are new.  I believe that at least one was in an issue of Vogue Knitting in the mid 90's.  I do not consider that a minus.  It is great to have all of her designs in one place so I don't have to tear up my magazine stash trying to find that one elusive issue.",

I see lots of Nicky Epstein's work style here. A great deal of color work, some delicate and some brighter. Some texture. In all quite a bit of variety, with great production values for the book itself.I would not recommend this for the beginner, unless you are really adventurous, or planning ahead to be an expert. There is little here to start off a new knitter safely. I would gather some good basic techniques and ensure that you don't have lots of bad habits first, before trying to tackle most of these.Some of the colorwork that looks really intimidating is simply duplicate stitch, so it's not nearly so difficult to  produce, but has impressive results. There are a couple of afghans here that would give me pause before tackling them, and I LIKE a challenge, so be warned.However, I think this is a fine book if you don't have lots of her other work in your collection. I had never seen any of these before, so I'm really pleased.I would caveat, though, that in my experience of working with her patterns before, to be really alert for what is on your needles v what is in the pattern. If in doubt, go with your needles. Also, I have nearly always found that she seems to prefer a much lighter fabric than I do, so I gauge down by at least 2 sizes, sometimes 3. If in doubt, gauge, gauge, gauge",

I bought the orange island native one & the blue one that had Cozumel on it in the photo, hoping to get the Cozumel pattern, but it doesn't have that on it.  The sizing chart is pretty true.  A lot of folks here have complained about oversizing of the LaLeela shirts.  I have a fabric tape measure and was able to measure one of my existing voluminous shirts against the dimensions given in the chart and ordered that size.  The belly, shoulders and airyness are just right, although the length doesn't seem to come down as far as mentioned on the chart as compared with one of my existing shirts.  Overall, the measure was real close to the chart given.  So if you wear XXL shirts like I do, then just get XL in the LaLeela, it should be right unless you want super airyness, then order your regular size and the shirt will be huge.  Overall, very nice and modestly airy airy at XL size, should work well for my trip to Cozumel.  I go there about once every two years, so I'm used to the humidity of the island and the lighter the fabric, the better.  Breezes can get a little coolish in the evening and things have a hard time drying there, so the less cotton clothing, the better.  This shirt should fill the bill.",

Casio called to advise that the watch arrived at their facility more than a year after purchase and therefore was not covered by the warranty.

I have owned a series of G Shocks over the past twenty years and I believe they are the best activity watches made at an affordable price.  I love this Titanium Pathfinder because it does so many things well and has an equally impressive appearance. The Titanium Pathfinder functions in a very similar manner to my original one, with some additional timers for yacht racing.  The main reason I bought this watch was my desire to own a good quality all metal Triple Sensor Pathfinder.  I was stunned to find this one on Amazon and at a price which was lower than I paid for the first one.  I became immediately interested because the components (case and wristband) are Titanium.  Titanium is the hottest metal going for all types of consumer goods including watches and appliances (like my refrigerator).  Another new feature for me was the solar powered movement.  My only disappointment is that it doesn't include atomic timekeeping; however the error tolerance (+ or - 15 seconds/month) is the same for the atomic Pathfinder and the solar Pathfinder.  I believe Casio now makes a solar powered atomic Pathfinder but it is considerably more expensive.  It appears that this model is being discontinued so you need to act quickly.  I am sure its replacement will be considerably more costly.",

Somehow, wearing this watch while engaging in these activities induces similar effects produced by smoking a cigarette -- calms you down when youre stressed, and pumps some pep when youre down.

Some reviews listed under this item are about different Pathfinder Protrek watches without the analog hands which I never seriously considered.  Analog dials have a great advantage - you can take a split-second glimpse and still know what time it is, and combined with digital dials they give you an abundance of available readings.  I have been looking for and buying only ana-digi watches like this because of their functionality and flexibility.The greatest selling point of this watch is the perfect combination of features that I am always looking for (listed in order of importance):- Analog-digital multi-function watch- Solar- Shock-resistant- Compass- Barometer- AltimeterSo far, I have been very proudly using this watch every day for two and a half years and it is still my #1 functionality-features watch in the world.  Although it's not listed as anti-shock but as \"Tough Solar\" it really is a very tough engineering work of art.  It still works perfectly even though it has gone through a significant number of abusing events.  Besides the annual vacation swims/dives in the sea and everyday normal movements, I'm an ex professional drummer who still frequently pats his knees in the rhythm of the music, and nowadays this watch has to withstand frequent clapping when listening to the music and playig with my daughter.  In addition, my 1.5 year old daughter used to play with it occasionally and she let it fall on the floor many times.  Moreover, this watch has two times received a hit that would have broken apart any other watch I have.  Once I accidentally hit a corner of a rock wall with it so hard that my hand hurt.  In spite of my expectations, all those abuses have only left a single barely visible scratch in the middle of the glass and several minor scratches on the bezel, so I can testify that the crystal/glass on it is very scratch resistant and the watch really is very tough.  I bought the titanium model/bracelet, so the entire watch is very light in spite of its size.The solar charging works great and the battery is almost always on H (high) position, and only in December during long nights and short days it sometimes goes to M (medium) and the contributing factor might be that I have the automatic backlight set up and it frequently lights up even when I don't need it.  When I get the M reading I can quickly charge the watch if I leave it in the window for half an hour during a sunny day because in the winter it is often covered with my sleeve when I'm outside.  Usually, instead of charging I like to push the envelope and see whether I can get it to L (low), but I've never seen that so far. At night and during prolonged low light conditions, the watch shuts off its digital displays to save power, but once you move the watch (or turn the backlight on), they turn on automatically and instantaneously.Some people complain about inaccurate temperature readings on watches like this, but you have to be aware that there is no way your watch will not get influenced by your body temperature, so you need to take it off and leave it for several minutes before you can get an accurate reading.  The only exception is when you are swimming/diving and you can obtain a reasonably accurate measurement of the water temperature in a matter of minutes without taking the watch off, especially if you are moving your arms and swimming or if water is otherwise flowing around the watch.The barometer/altimeter is accurate (of course, if you adjust it prior to your trip to a known reference point).  I always watch it on the airplane where you can tell which passenger plane keeps the air pressure best (or also which company is trying to save and scrape on air supplies and maintain low pressure)  - sometime you'll see the pressure drop about 33% before they adjust it and so the reading of the altimeter in a pressurized plane cabin is not at all accurate.  The internal artificial pressure they keep in the passenger cabin usually corresponds to 4000-6500 feet above the sea level.The compass function works well, but I think they should have allowed it to work for a longer and possibly adjustable period of time before shutting itself off automatically after 20 seconds.  I know it takes a considerable amount of battery power to run the compass but still, I'd like to have the option to run it for 30 seconds or a minute without having to press the button repeatedly.There is more I'd like to see and buy in a better watch and I have been looking for it for years, but I still haven't seen one as good as this.The only two main competitors I considered for a while were Tissot's T-Touch and Citizen's Eco-Drive Skyhawk.  The T-Touch watch, as seen in the James Bond movie is a bit less bulky and more dressy, so it looks better, but you have to spend about double the amount on it.  Still, if it were solar I wouldn't hesitate to buy it, but since it's not, in my referent system that translates to a waste of time and money when the battery runs out and a questionable water resistance after replacement, so it's out of the question.  Citizen's similar solar bulky watch Eco-Drive Skyhawk is a bit more dressy, but its digital and analog dials are not independent and from some reviews I can also conclude that it's definitely not as tough and resistant as this one.  Omega had an amazing ana-digi multi-function Speedmaster X-33 watch that was a serious candidate for my favorite, however, that one was not solar powered, it was many times more expensive, and it is not being made any more, so Casio's PRG60T-7V still owns the \"THE WATCH\" title in my world.Some minor cons:- I'm 6'3\" and not skinny, and although together with the titanium bracelet it does have a rugged sturdy look, I'd like it to be a bit smaller, and definitely thinner.- Position of start/stop/reset buttons on the stop watch function is unusual.  The lower right button is used to start and stop and the upper right is used to reset (I'm used to the opposite).- The color of the first circular layer under the bezel (I suppose this is the solar charging part) is gray but in some light it gets an ugly-ish  purple shade- It takes a long time to circle almost 12 hours if your watch is one minute fast because I can only adjust the hands forward.  Fortunately, the watch is pretty accurate and I only do this several times a year, two  times because of the DST switch.Things I would like to see in a future improved model:- Atomic world-wide time adjustments- Count down timer.All in all, this is as good as it gets. I have been searching for a better watch for years, but I still haven't found what I'm looking for.",

    "reviewText": "I have the watch for 3 years now, and am very satisfied. It was quite a challenge though to get the 'lunitidal interval' value needed to display the correct tidal data. The manual lists the required numbers for several cities around the world, but tidal dynamics are extremely complicated and tides can differ several hours even when you go up north or south of the same coast. What made it more complicated, was that I am living in a country where English is not the main language, and I had no idea what I was looking for in local terms. Finally, I understood that lunitidal interval is known here as \"gemiddeld havengetal\" (Dutch), but still it was a real challenge to find it for the spot of coast I was planning to use the watch. It was not on the internet - ultimaltely I was able to find it in a specialized yearly nautical publication. I can imagine that not being able to find the right data, might let some users down. Casio should have realized this and should have put more effort into guiding the user to the right values. It might be the reason Casio left this option out of the newer Sea-Patchfinder models. For users in The Netherlands: I have uploaded a table at [...]As far as the watch: one problem I have with it, is that it does not have dual time, which I really need. Second, I do not understand why Casio has chosen not to print a complete 360 degree scale around the watch, but chose to print COMP, BARO and START in between the 210 and 330 degree values instead. Especially since it is also shown near the buttons as well as on the display at about the same spot. OK, it is nice to have a compass and a barometre, but don't need to read THREE times every time I look at my watch. Another disadvantage is that it is impossible to verify that the watch is level when using the compass. Especially at sea, this is essential. The watch does have some sort of tilt sensor to automatically switch on the light when you look at your wrist - it would have been nice if this feature had been used to indicate if the watch was level.A small disadvantage is the short lighting period. Having so many batteries aboard, this period could have been longer than 1.5 seconds. Also, it would have been nice if the moon graph was inverted - with the positive display showing the lighted part of the moon. Standing outside in the dark and pressing the light switch, results in seeing the dark part of the moon lighted up on your watch... Also, a button lock would have been nice. Because of its size, it is easy to press a button by mistake. Especially the Baro-button is prone to be pressed inadvertially when bending your wrist, supporting yourself during an activity.Otherwise, a perfect watch, which is extremely light for its size. The distinct beep when you return to time mode, is very handy. The glass does not scratch, it is perfectly protected by the bezel ring. I am looking for a replacement after 3 years, since the black plastic light switch broke off (it is only supported at the back by a small metal pin which is off-center, so pressing it eventually makes the connection snap) and the barometric pressure sensor went offline recently. Since I really need dual time and I do not like the newer Pathfinder model using about 1/4 of the display telling me about the battery status (what a waste of space!), I decided to compromise the tidal data and buy a Suunto watch (with button lock and sensor that indicates if the compass is level) next.",

The manual go back and forth on its usefulness.The altimeter readings are useless; they have to be recalibrated every time you change altitudes significantly.The thermometer is accurate -- but only if aren't wearing the watch for 30 minutes!The countdown timer goes up only to 60 minutes.The backlight doesn't have the \"stay on\" feature that Timex indiglo watches have.

I have had this Citizen watch for a little over two years now, and I have never had any problems with it.  The watch still looks like new.  The sapphire face is virtually indestructable.

I've watched every series, movie and even the short lived cartoon series so when I saw this watch I had to have it.Those who have actually seen the original Star Trek series staring William Shatter as James T Kirk will immediately recognize that shade of yellow and that unique font. It's a great design for any fan of the original series.The watch has a leather band and stainless steel back. It keeps time perfectly and so far the battery is working great.My only complaint is that the Star Fleet emblem looks a bit fuzzy on my watch, I don't know if they all have this issue but you don't notice the problem unless you're looking very close so it's not a big deal.This watch isn't an official Star Trek product by any stretch of the imagination, but I knew it wasn't when I bought it and I'm glad I bought it. Sometimes an unofficial product can add flavor to a collection; it adds a sort of variety that official products alone can't provide.Considering the low, low price and the quality of the product I would recommend this watch to any Star Trek collector and the yellow color really brightens up my watch assortment.- Live long and prosper",

However, the color is right and the length is right. The wig seems a little thin, because really if you try to style it any other way, you'll see through to your hair; or if you don't style it just right. Considering I'll be cutting the top part of it off and sewing a white wig in it's place for a Pascal cosplay, it should do nicely. I don't believe this would be something you would want to wear multiple days of the week. I can see for a convention when you want to spend time making sure the details are perfect.

Does it have cool, classic Moleskine styling?  Yes.  But is it worth it?  Probably not.The three things a luggage tag needs to do is: identify the owner of the bag, provide the bag with a distinctive mark for the owner to quickly retrieve it, and provide a distinctive mark so that non-owners don't accidentally take it.It does the first well enough, except that unlike other tags it doesn't have any way (via a removable business card or the like) to change the information.  Once you write in there, it's good.The second two, it doesn't do as well, at least in black.  Yes, it's distinctive, but not _that_ distinctive.  In my case, it's just another black tag on a black bag.  The other color tags would definitely add more pop and distinctiveness, but also lose the homely Moleskine charm.All in all, it seems sturdy enough to take abuse and will hold your information in it, but does it justify the price differential versus something you could pick up at a drug store?  No, probably not.",
